When asked for actual numbers on what I was expected to hit during my time I was told that an actual number was impossible to give due to the nature of the process paths.

One minute they say that they want you to have work life balance, the next they say that if you really want to get ahead that you have to put in many, many hours to get ahead.

They issue an annual employee survey where the purpose is to take the temperature of the employees and how they like to work at Microsoft. Each of the years that I was there, our direct manager would have a meeting with us and would say ""if you have any problems at all, we would appreciate it if you told us in advance of the survey so we can work things out"". This to me is just purely unethical - You are essentially strong armed into providing responses that are not honest for fear of it coming back to bite you professionally. Managers seem to be ""graded"" on this so if they have a small group of reports, then it wouldn't be too hard for them to figure out who said what (or they may assume).  Speaking of surveys - they do the same with their customers as well. This is a big metric within MS and reps have to be very careful as to who they get to fill out their surveys in order to get a good response. Have literally seen reps blatantly ask for good marks rather than honest ones.  Political - very political internally. There are people who have been there for years and are very much an ""inner circle"". People are some-what click'ish.  Not really a ""negative"" but just different - Very different sales cycle and unique from most other sales organizations. July, there is nothing going on, August through ~October is mostly ""sales planning"".

I will try to elaborate, I was working as L4 employee, full time permanent and salary is super low when comparing same positions in Amazon and other companies. Other companies are offering at least 50% higher income when comparing with Amazon HR Services in Prague and better benefits.  Many youngsters start their first job there straight off college or high school, so don't expect good work ethics, respect or knowledge from them as building is filled with them. Lot of mess!  Team Managers are one word...'joke'!!! Zero experience in people management, zero empathy, most of them don't even bother to listen to their direct reports and they're only looking after themselves and their 'career' path.  Senior management isn't very far from TM's, they're only looking after themselves and trying to impress their own managers over other people backs.  Lot of people will give you their hand, but with other hand behind their back ready to backstab you!  Also, other benefits which Amazon in Prague is advertising as benefits are ridiculous. Example, health care. Health care in Czech Republic is public, which means it's paid through your salary, so you will have it regardless of where you are working. Public transport reimbursement is also advertised, however they fail to say to you that you will pay yourself for full price then once you ask for reimbursement, they will deduct around 20-25% of tax from your salary.  Working from home also...it's so rare you might get it once a month or you won't even get it. Salary increase is non-existent, this year they offered us salary increase of 50CZK per month (fifty CZK) which equals to €2 , which is complete disgrace for Amazon and the richest company in the world.  Career opportunities don't exist, cause your manager won't let you go, and they will hire someone from outside with zero experience into HR rather than hiring an internal candidate. Recruiters are rude, they lack of communication skills, and Amazon's 2&5 promise doesn't exist.  Amazon was a good company to work for, once it came to Prague, but now, they are just horrible.

The company was structured more as a collection of startups than a coherent entity. This led to very strange internal billing and hour allocation practices. For instance, I wanted to implement a feature for someone who sat next to me (another developer who was a user of our product), but since he was technically on a different team we had to get management approval and so on and so forth for the additional work. What could have been solved with 15 minutes of coding took 3 weeks, several design documents, and probably collectively 10-15 hours of people's time.

If you need a harder challenge, they will give you one. The company moves fast and is very innovative. They know what it means to be creative. There is always room for people to learn and grow. Amazon is a career accelerator. It is a trial by fire, but you will come away being a far better employable individual than you were before you set foot in the door.  Management is generally pretty good -- on an individual level at least.  The company is also insane as a whole. They make very strange trade-offs, which somehow end up working out for them (as noted with the market valuation of the company).  The people you work with are competent. Amazon has a very high interview bar, and it shows. You can trust that the person you're working with will do their job to the best of their ability, and they will challenge you in return. You gotta make sure you're up-to-date and on your toes, because anything that might be incorrect that you say or do will get challenged and brought to light.","Amazon.com, LLC treats its employees probably the worst of any ""top-tier"" tech company. The number of truly useful benefits they have is small. Their claim that the cash you're making makes up for the lack of benefits is incorrect -- other companies are now paying more with better benefits.  You feel like the company doesn't care about you or your job. The attrition rate is so high that most teams lose about 50% of their talent every 2 years, so there's a lot of technical debt, and you risk finding yourself on a team whose only job is to clean up legacy code that nobody has touched since 2005 -- you don't get promoted that way, but someone has to do it.  The company wants to put all its engineers on-call. If you're not on-call, you're working to become on-call. There is little-to-no ops layer, such that they restrict when you can take vacation during the Christmas holiday. They will page you whenever they decide they need you, including if you're on vacation.  The likelihood that you'll get fed up with the company and decide to rage-quit after ~2 years is very high, don't plan on being at the company longer than that.  If you're a pregnant mother or expect to become a mother -- forget it, don't even consider this company. They demand too much of your time, and they will make you feel like you have to choose between your job and your baby.  Check the list of ""top tech companies to work for"" anytime from the beginning of time until now, you'll find that Amazon is rarely if never on that list, and there is a reason for it.","There is a lot in the Amazon ""corporate DNA"" that needs to go. 'Nix the door desks, make parking free -- you own the buildings. Re-evaluate the way you treat your employees and do something to stem the tide of horrid attrition that is causing you to burn out bright stars and causing your technical debt to jump through the roof. By making a few simple investments in your employees and their quality of life, by showing them you actually care by your actions instead of your words -- you'll turn Amazon.com, LLC into a force more fearsome than Google or anything that has been seen before.

I frequently encountered coworkers who, like me, felt themselves to be ""the dumbest Googler."" No one wants to write inferior code or to be thought of as doing so, and for me, the pressure in a public-facing role was even greater.

You learn things, for better or worse, and grow in your career.  If you are in a department with good morale and product you can have lots of fun in your work and get to know many great people.","Its a very passive aggressive workplace. Not many people will tell you to your face if they have issues with you. They will go to your manager or coworkers though. It makes you feel as if you have to watch yourself at all times as you never know what someone is saying behind your back. Depending on the department you may or may not get much work life balance. Some departments are great but others are horrible. The horrible ones may know it and really don't care. You either work the massive hours or leave.  The review system is horrible. You have a great bunch of smart motivated employees who are all striving to do their best. However the review system forces someone to get a negative review. If you get a negative review you have zero options. You cannot move anywhere in the company, you are not even allowed to interview, and get zero monetary compensation for your work. Employees are so worried about getting a poor review that they compete in a negative way against each other. Other employees are seen as threats to their review scores. Its almost impossible to truly collaborate when you are worried helping your co-workers will negatively impact your performance review.  The managers will tell you 'its only an evaluation for 1 year's worth of work'. However its almost impossible to recover from a negative review. You can try your hardest but the management will say 'we're giving opportunities to others with better reviews'. At the end of the next year you'll be in the same place, not for lack of trying, but for lack of support from management and not getting additional opportunities to succeed. You'll end up leaving or being asked to leave because of supposed 'poor performance'. But the review system forced someone to be at the bottom even if everyone on the team did well. Its a very crazy system.","Many of the legacy top management consider leaving, or get some intense training on how to do things differently. Any management that supports the kind of review system that will not allow employees to truly collaborate is in my opinion not the best senior leadership.  Microsoft has been behind in many recent technology innovations (smart phones, tablets, etc) and some of their current technologies have lost significant market share (Internet Explorer, Hotmail, Office, etc). The Millennial generation uses Google and Apple. You'll find college students now that have never used a Microsoft product in their lives. If the company wants to remain relevant it has to change.  Could it be that employees are so worried about their performance reviews they won't take risks anymore?

It is fun to meet them and work with them. The Kellogg alumni at MS are especially helpful and nice.  2. Networking/Company Culture The company encourages a lot of networking and exchange of information. It allows you to meet people from other groups and learn about their projects. It is nice to know that the work you're doing does not stay in a vacuum and that you are able to leverage other people's knowledge and best practices, so that you're not spinning your wheels.  3. Opportunities It is encouraged to rotate and spend 16 - 18 months with different groups and doing different things, so it gives everyone a great opportunity to network within the company and try different things.","1. Team Culture My team had an intense culture, due to all being ex-consultants and due to working on the strategy of the flagship product. It was a different culture than I expected and was therefore disappointed. However, I did enjoy working and collaborating with them. It was more of a personality and style issue. So my advice would be to interview the team as they are interviewing you during the second round.  2. Size of the Company The company felt really big and it felt like it could swallow someone who was not doing the ""right"" things (e.g. networking constantly, changing jobs every 18 months, working intensely on side projects, etc.). I felt like it added an extra step on the responsibilities that came with the job.  3. Seattle Seattle was a fun city to be over the summer.

I loved almost everyone that I worked with. You need to have a certain attitude to work at Apple, and if you fit in then you just fit in. Don't get me wrong though--although they do look for a certain attitude, our team was very diverse. I met so many interesting people there, and i still keep in touch with many of them. Pay was pretty good compared to other mall jobs. Discounts here are okay but not amazing, though the free MobileMe account is definitely nice if you own multiple Apple products.","Though I had lots of great customer interactions here, I also encountered a LOT of extraordinarily rude customers. I have had customers personally attack me (for example, dropping f-bombs on me when I told them that they'd need to wait 5-10 minutes to see a Genius, and telling me I'm incompetent even though fixing iPhones isn't in my job description) and almost cried in the Red Zone on multiple occasions. Managers push numbers hard--even though you don't make commission. We actually had a wall that had not only the best sales numbers for the day, but also the worst, which I find completely inappropriate. Totally inflexible scheduling. Although I was part-time, they worked me as many hours as possible and you need to request off work several months in advance, even if it's just one day. Then, my biggest gripe--there is literally no room for advancement here. They tell you that there is plenty of room to grow with Apple, but in reality, they hire outside the company for almost all of the management positions. There isn't much incentive to perform when there is little chance of growth. And forget moving to corporate--it's pretty much completely separate from the Retail division. Finally, the vibe here is (surprise, surprise) a bit cult-ish...there are special procedures for doing literally everything, even giving a compliment to your co-worker. You are expected to do your job and never, ever question the company or its motives. Plus, they've created this image for themselves that attracts all these ridiculously talented and educated people to work for them, when in reality they are vastly overqualified for their jobs. One coworker interned for NASA. Another was fluent in six languages. Yet another was an experienced music producer.

As a result the ""bar"" for working there has certainly changed over time - but let me tell you Microsoft still has a lot of smart people working there. The challenge is finding the right place for yourself where you 'click' with your peers and more important your management and feel it is the right place for you.  -- Types of opportunities Microsoft offers a little bit of something for anyone interested in computer science, consumer project management, marketing, etc. Computer Science problems galore from operating system kernels (windows, windows phone, xbox, windows embedded), games (xbox, pc games, mobile games), search engines (bing.com, FAST), productivity software (office, sharepoint), compilers (CLR, CLR for mobile, Visual Studio), etc. etc. with something to offer for just about anyone.  Outside of tech specific jobs, Microsoft has a huge legal department, hr department, etc. Keep in mind that even though each of those departments has a core set of employees as much as possible that is not business essential is farmed out to vendors and contractors as well - which can be a totally different spin on ""working for"" Microsoft.  --- Getting things done: You can find an expert in just about anything. Finding others that share a passion for a specific type of technology, a specific type of business problem, or a particular area of research is usually very easy. Especially if you are not afraid of asking people for a push in the right direction in email over and over until you find someone that is right to tackle a problem you're focused on. But it requires the soft skills of working in the BIG (and I mean BIG) company that Microsoft has now become. But this can lead you to the pm/dev/tester/architect that owns that problem set and is more than willing to bring you up to speed on the focus of their passion. Huge plus!","-- Job scope Microsoft has grown into a company where a lot of the jobs have rigidly defined scopes and it becomes about doing whatever it is that will please your maanger and maybe one to two of their peers to do ""well"" at review time. It used to take an understanding of the product and the business and someone that was willing to step up and ""do the right thing"" at the right time to make sure the product would ship on time and with high quality. Now it feels that more people just look to management to spoon feed them what they will do for the next day or week... I miss the vision each person used to take into the job where they wanted to become the world expert in ____ and make that area they owned the best code / solution possible. Again - this could be an artifact of the large growth and maybe there are just as many folks still doing what I am wishing for as there was 15 years ago but it gets drowned out in the signal:noise ratio.","--Senior Management There are a lot of VPs and a lot of Partners.  ""Partner"" is an attribution in a title (like ""Partner Development Manager"", ""Partner Group Program Manager"", ""Partner Development Manager"") that means the person is withing grasp of getting a ""Vice President"" title. It is possible to achieve ""Partner"" as either a manger or an individual contributor.  There are probably 200+ VPs and ~1500 partners. They shape the core of the senior management and are in large part what set the agenda for the business and the core R&D work that will be done throughout the product groups. Each of them has gotten to their position by being noticed for their efforts and are recognized and rewarded extraordinarily well.  It feels (and this may be unfair - but it is my perspective) that a great deal of these VPs and Partners are actually counterproductive to the business. Many of them seems to be a caricature of themselves overly accentuating the negative aspects of their personalities with only a few being able to escape this criticism. Many seem like overpaid and overgrown children unwilling to sit at the table and negotiate between each other and set long term shared goals that are a compromise and work towards a common infrastructure and reduction in overlap of the groups they own.  Advice specifically to the management of Microsoft: - Everything you vps and partners do is a complete chess game trying to figure out how to make the next guy look less favorable than themselves. It's unacceptable. At that level you get paid enough that this shouldn't be the goal - grow up and figure out how to make peace with each other and drive towards combined goals of greater efficiency.  - By the time someone becomes a VP or Partner at Microsoft they have lost their technical edge and very very very few of them could actually go into their own group's software and make fixes or have anything to actually contribute to the day to day life of an individual developer or tester on the team.  - Don't attempt to take the latest ""management technique"" from Facebook/Netflix/Whatever Co. that you read about in an in-flight magazine on the way back from Hawaii and apply it to a group of 2000 people under you that were not hired to fit the mold of that company's philosophy and culture.",3.5,,3.5,3.0,2.0,5

Most project teams are very small - a few people at the most. Often there are only one or two key engineers directly responsible for features or key project areas. Because of how small teams are, it makes it very easy to approach key players and influence product direction. Conversely, key engineers don't have much bureaucracy to cut through to implement innovative new ideas. It is because of this culture of innovation, as well as a culture of excellence, that working at Apple has been one of the best experiences of my professional career.","Because of the small business mindset, and the decentralized nature of the decision making and product direction, Apple at times lacks the structure that other companies have set up. There are very few departments that are isolated from their customers - so the process and structure that each group attempts to establish can be heavily influenced or even ignored by those who need to use a back door method of getting work done. It is possible that project managers may pressure engineers or other staff to complete work faster than their managers agreed upon, where in larger companies this behavior would be frowned upon, or forbidden. Some structure is necessary to keep a happy medium, and at times Apple could use more structure.","Plan ahead more, and don't wait until the last minute to make key decisions. No one wants to work for months on a feature, only to have it cut 4 weeks before shipping the product.

They claim to give higher salaries as opposed to other bay area companies but that amount is nothing if you really compare with other companies.

Overeducating is a no-no but you will find them doing this.  -You are basically encouraged to hurry the cust through the phone call and if they cannot speak English (no spanish support) you are encouraged to have them get an interpreter--also if they are not computer savvy (like some elderly people) you are encouraged to have them try back later when they can get someone to help them. Its basically refer refer refer refer when you can. Not really customer service based or rather not really customer-based.  -Telus very strict scheduling environment.

19653,startup_4,"Seattle, WA"," Mar 10, 2016",Current Employee , Senior Manager,Transformational career experience - Amazon Web Services,"Working for AWS has been the highlight of my career thus far. I've spent more than 4 years at the company - with a short break in the middle. So many learning opportunities in this company and opportunities to make a difference at all levels. Despite being a larger company there is plenty of chance to be impactful whether you're in the field, in engineering, or sales and marketing roles. The rate of change in the business has been exponential over these past years and being part of that growth has been eye opening. The company tends to be pretty flat and really live its leadership principles. It's a very common theme for people to think they're just put up on a wall for people to read - but they're not - they really are interwoven into everything that people do. The customer obsession vs. competitor obsession is refreshing to someone like me who has spent a bunch of time in the tech industry. A generally humble company which is always looking to improve and do the right thing for customers. Also like the fact that nothing is beneath people in the company - a stark difference to other companies where ""execs"" are considered unapproachable and aloof. Most approachable group of senior execs I have ever encountered. When I left AWS I missed it intensely and was pleased to return. I think it's a transformational environment and one that changes you and has developed and improved me to a pretty incredible degree. Very lucky to have had a lot of the experiences that I have had.","Delivering and insisting on the highest standards is not for everyone. If you're working on product launches and it becomes crunch time then you are likely to be working harder than a regular 9-5 job. With that said, though, I've got many friends who manage a good work life balance. Some roles make that easier than others so it's worth choosing wisely. Amazon isn't a company that coddles its employees though...so if you want the chef prepared free food, and massages at your desk, then this isn't the place for you. It's also not particularly structured for career development. Both of these things aren't particularly important to me - I roll my eyes a little at the over-the-top perks I see in the valley and the approach to career development here completely suits me - but it requires you to be comfortable being a self-starter and to deal with ambiguity. That's not right for everyone and not what everyone wants.","I think it's worth making more investment in training and development for employees who aren't as much of self-starters. I don't think that means lowering the bar but just recognizing that as the company grows we might need more than one type of person. I also think that particularly in groups like AWS where there's more competition than in other areas it's worth doing more analysis on some fringe benefits. Doesn't mean a cultural change to be ridiculous, but there are small improvements that would likely have larger impacts.",3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2

I've not spotted anyone crying at their desk or in the toilets, but plenty of people just leave for a workplace that values its employees more. Amazon is congenitally tight-fisted on everything except salary: this is the corporate principle of 'frugality'. Amazon genuinely does put its customers first, at the expense of employees. Whether this is a good thing or not for investors in the long-term, I don't know - it seems to be working well for them so far.

There is really no limit to the kind of product you can work on, so as your passions go, so can your place in the company.","Oversight at the middle management layer is really terrible. A manager is only as good as s/he chooses to be, and there is no real accountability for a manager being good or bad. To be clear, there are some employees who choose to be really great managers, and there are others who look at being a manager a personal career stepping stone and don't take their direct reports' careers seriously. What's more, many managers are individual contributors as well, so they have to look out for themselves as well as try to manage their team. Finally, many employees believe that being a manager is a step up the ladder, so that becomes an defining goal, but they may not develop the skills to be successful at it. I believe strongly that if Microsoft incentivized their managers to be great managers, the effectiveness of their direct reports would go up.","1) Tie manager rewards to the poll results. 2) Be consistent. This is a personal issue for me, but Microsoft made a big deal about adjusting the health benefits to reduce cost, yet they offer free soda to their employees. Free soda has no health benefits (the caffeine is pretty insignificant) and a pretty big health cost (it contributes to obesity). If you care about health cost, why give out something that may contribute to poorer health among your employees? You wouldn't give out free cigarettes or beer, and while those are more problematic than soda, it's all a gradient.

First, your experience will depend completely on your manager - good manager = good experience, bad manager = bad experience. Microsoft has failed for a long time to effectively train, develop and mentor their first-tier managers and this is the core of their failures. Second, there is still far too much ""busywork"" that doesn't apply to a particular role's core execution. Does a developer really need to know how to sell a Surface? I agree that ""everybody sells"" but Microsoft seems to be lost in a morass of everybody sells everything...and the portfolio is just to broad and diverse for that to be the case.","Microsoft's performance management process is now completely subjective based on manager's perception of ""impact"". It's possible to beat all of your MBOs and excel...but still be reviewed poorly because of a perception of low ""impact"". Conversely, someone can miss their MBOs completely but be highly reviewed due to ""impact"". As the manager feedback process has been eliminated there is no check at all on the process - so this now becomes a popularity contest if the manager is less-than-ethical in their performance management. Don't perceive that the ""stack rank"" process is gone - it's still alive and well and now allows managers to promote and reward favorites regardless of their actual performance.

Finance roles seen as data aggregation roles, not as analysts or business influencers. Poor finance tools, bad data scattered across groups, hard to get access, ad hoc manual processes. Long hours and high stress. Fast growth has led to hiring whoever is available so if you are unemployed you can get a job at Amazon, but be prepared to work in a dysfunctional group with bad managers where employees are seen as consumable resources, not assets. Weak managers, low job satisfaction, high turnover so constantly doing multiple jobs to cover open heads, long unsatisfying hours. Met many in finance in different Amazon businesses and across the board finance jobs had low satisfaction. High levels of frustration and stress - the faster growing the group the greater the stress. Many folks hired in who don't realize what they are getting into as Amazon desperate to hire then alters roles. Outside of finance, also demanding but met various people who liked their work, but not any within finance. Weekly reporting cycle is also a grind that detracts from value add work (in contrast to monthly reporting in most companies).

Beware of bonuses offered by Amazon. If you leave before the vesting period you could end up owing Amazon more than you actually received. Example suppose you receive 30K in signing bonuses and relocation expenses, and you decide to leave or are let go before your 24 months is up. Amazon pre-deducts the taxes for your bonuses up front, so you may only actually get a check for 20K and the other 10K goes to the government. If you leave after the tax cycle ends, then Amazon will want back their full 30K and you will have to figure out how to get the rest back from the IRS on your own. Also, even if you pay them the full 30K there is a very high degree of possibility that they will not send you an updated W2 and will hope you just let them keep the 10K tax free.

I get that we have to pick 120 units per hour in order to get the orders out on time, but do you have to remind me every time my rate is low? Just leave me alone and let me do my job. Damn. And every time my rate was low, I always got mad at myself which made me focus on that rather than the task at hand. Also, I didn't like that they started ranking us from the picker with the highest rate to the picker with the lowest rate. Is this a competition?  TOT TOT stands for Time Off Task. They calculate TOT from the time you finish a pick to the next time you finish a pick, so if, for instance, you use the washroom. This will not only affect your rate, but your TOT, also. I get it. The less time you spend picking, the less productive you are. I didn't like that everything was timed. Maybe I'm a little salty because ultimately, TOT was what got me fired, but who's to know?  Short Lunch Break Another thing I didn't like was that the lunch break was too short. As a full timer you get a full 30 minute lunch break. FULL 30 MINUTES. Had to make sure the people in the back heard me. By the time I've used the washroom, checked my blood sugar and made my lunch, I have a FULL 15 MINUTES to eat and relax. I know that blood sugar part was personal, but still not enough time for a break. Bottom line, I think the break could've at least been 45 minutes.  Long Hours As a full timer, I worked from 5a.m. - 4:30p.m., with the exception of two 15 minute breaks, and a 30 minute break in which we had to clock in and out of. So, all in all I worked 10.5 hours. As you'd imagine, at the end of the day I'm exhausted and my feet hurt.  Physically Demanding This is a very physically demanding job. Depending on your schedule, you're on your feet for 5-10 hours. Plus, you have to bend, ascend and descend a latter (as as a full timer who's only 5'2"", I was on a ladder at least 50 times a day), push a cart and sometimes lift heavy grocery bags. As a picker, you have to move pretty fast. Combine that with being in ambient (it's 70 degrees in there) and you'd swear you're in a cardio class. I'd be sweating bullets in there. It was not pretty.  Having to Work in Different Temperatures Amazon fresh has three different picking areas: Chilled, Ambient and Frozen, however they combine these areas to make mixed batches: there's Chilled Ambient, Frozen Chilled and Frozen Ambient. This means that you might have to go from the freezing cold to room temperature in a matter of 30 minutes. I've gotten sick several times from having to do this.","Specifically have someone prepare carts and dry ice toppers. Fix carts with yellow handles. They swivel too much.

It's a job that allows you to learn a lot from experience and also from training. The interaction with customers is energizing.","Exploitive. Apple retail keeps people in the lower-paying rung of ""specialist"" while utilizing your expertise to fill in for people who get paid more doing tech and training (and not promoting). It's getting worse and worse. Many would be willing to be ""utility players"" and do more than one role, but the pay and official title stays on the lower scale. I also think there is a ""bait and switch"" in the recruiting process where Apple contacts people with training and tech skills with the promise of Creative or Genius, lures them to work for Apple, but then keeps them in the Red Zone.  Lots of part-time positions, with crappy and inconsistent hours (I know, this is retail), managers are increasingly micromanaging issues to keep employees from progressing for silly rules (i.e.: gum chewing and color or pattern or shirts worn under Apple shirt) and employees who give great customer experiences (NPS) are not acknowledged in terms of advancement, it has more to do with kissing up to management and saying the correct corporate gobbelty-gook. Suck-ups are rewarded. Age-ism can be an issue at some stores. Pay is not great. Employee store meetings are rah-rah annoying. People are feeling unhappy about the lack of movement.

Depending on your group, this can lead to cut-throat competition, as people compete for a good rank, since you are pitted against your peers. This system rewards and recognizes self-promoters at the expense of quieter, but solid contributors. You never feel like you've done enough and can relax.  Poor work/life balance. Microsoft is stubbornly reluctant to open up to working from home, when many other companies have already embraced it. There is a well worn sentiment internally that we tout software that helps remote teams collaborate, yet we refuse to.  Consultants are expected to travel 100% (Mon-Thu) with little flexibility or sympathy for its impact on their personal lives. Management sentiment is that you can't complain because you get paid well. You do (and your bonus depends on your hours), but they get zero points for sensitivity.  Most of the pressure to be on site every week comes from our own management, even when customers are flexible.  Consultants have a quota of billable hours to meet annually. This quota does not include travel time, which you have to make up.  There is a strong Kool-Aid atmosphere. The sense of blind passion often feels phony, as if we're all trying to act out our slogan. Internal training videos remind us how excited we are about our products and what we can do to share that excitement. Probably because of the ranking system, people compete to out-passion each other and everything is ""awesome"". I've seen consultants express regret at the cancellation of a high profile status meeting. It just feels fake, but I understand where it comes from. If you're not passionate enough, you might not get a good rating. I don't think this is a heathy culture. Real passion and excitement comes with a counterdose of skepticism and criticism. The latter is conspicuously rare. Senior management must understand that merely soliciting feedback and holding open office hours is not enough when you have the cloud of a ranking system hanging over your head.

There were a couple people I knew that liked it, but they came from the construction industry and liked working at Amazon for the consistent pay and hours. Everyone else I knew disliked working in this position due to the impossible rate/quality expectations, the extreme boredom and the physical requirements. It is 100% impossible to comply with every company policy at the same time. For example - - You're expected to meet a RATE, where you have to stow a certain number of items per week. It's not a straightforward concept, as in 1000 items per day - each item has its own time limit/rate (something like - large items 30 per hour, medium items 60 per hour, small items 120 per hour), so it's not possible to personally calculate whether you're meeting the rate or not. Managers (or Problem Solvers) post a list of all working employee rates throughout the day, or sometimes once per day, and that's how you can figure out how well you're doing rate-wise. - There's also a QUALITY standard, where you're expected to stow about 1100 (or 1200?) items without making more than 1 error (according to the scanner). - And multiple rules on how items can be stored... as in items cannot be sticking out over the shelf more than the width of your badge, items cannot be more than 50% above the divider (between each shelf), all items on shelf must be visible, liquid items must be placed upright, etc. The warehouse looks like an episode of hoarders. The shelves are stuffed to the brim with items, and this requirement in and of itself would be physically impossible to meet. - Time off Task (TOT) - So as a shower, your job is to stow items out of 12 ""totes"" (storage bins), which are located on a large cart that you push around the warehouse. The time required to remove and replace the empty totes (and cart) back to the que, find out where the full carts are located, grab a cart, and push the cart to an aisle with as much space as you can find counts against your rate. It's not necessarily TOT, unless it takes you more than 6 minutes to do. However, if it does take you more than 6 minutes, or if you spend six minutes doing something else without scanning an item and scanning a shelf (such as using the bathroom which takes about 4 minutes round trip to get back and forth from, speaking with your manager or HR) you will accrue TOT.  The strict requirements of the position make it an extremely stressful job, especially (but not only) during the peak season. Also, as other people have pointed out, breaks are about 5 minutes, considering the time required to walk to and from the break room. These are only the most prominent cons and the ones that all stowers at the San Bernardino location will have to deal with.",Consider the treatment of the majority of employees and decide whether this is a position you want to be in.,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2

I applied for part time many times while working here, showing them my schedule to prove that I'm a full time student. Got denied every single time without reasoning. Just kept on telling me to apply so I can keep getting turned down with no reasoning.  Third, any person with a Liberal Arts degree can be manager.

First day employees come in the warehouse with big smiles because Amazon has tricked them with the high pay rate, but two weeks in the job their smiles flip upside down because they realize how much this job sucks. There's barely no interaction with people if you're doing universal receive. Just at a station all by yourself for 10hrs with 3 breaks in between. Imagine being stuck in your room for 10hrs doing the same thing over and over again with no interaction from the outside world. You will go insane.  Fifth, the hardest part about this job isn't even the work itself. It's trying to keep your mental state from breaking down because being alone for so many hours can make you think nothing but bad thoughts. You get 40 UPT (Unpaid time hours) when you first work here. You can use it anytime you want to and you're going to want to use it everyday because you do not want to be in this place for more than 2-6hrs. Once you run out of UPT, you're forced to stay here for the 10hrs they scheduled you for. Many employees have come up to me telling me that this place gives them suicidal thoughts. THIS ISN'T A GOOD WORK ENVIRONMENT!  Nobody at this warehouse likes this job. My first week here this lady told me that this job will drive anybody insane. I didn't believe at first but 3months into this job and I can't take this crap no more. I'm quitting hopefully in 2 weeks tops. If you have a social life outside this job, kiss that goodbye because you're probably going to spend most of your days in this hell we call a warehouse. Don't come into this job thinking that management is going to treat you good because you're nothing but a number in their eyes. They'll replace you quicker than they hired you.  I'm sorry this is so long but I can't stress this hard enough, please don't work here. I wouldn't recommend my worst enemies this job. This job makes me want to quit everything in life. School, work and life. This job is so stressful and does a lot of damage mentally. Don't get this job unless it's a last resort and even if it's a last resort, look for another job that will treat you better.

It's the fastest-growing large company in the world, so it has a lot of resources and a lot of challenges that will help you improve as a recruiter. Most of the people you work with, especially the teams you support, are extremely smart and fun people. Amazon is a well-known and a (mostly) sought-after employer. You help build teams that build products that impact tens or hundreds of millions of people and often make the news. They are slowly but steadily improving the benefits to their employees - more supportive parental leave policies, more liberal internal transfer policies, better offices/buildings. They also generally pay well against the overall market. They are a challenging place to recruiter as well, while that can be less than fun at times, it means you will become a better recruiter quickly. I'm pretty confident that someone who can successfully work at Amazon for a year or two can go on to be successful at pretty much any other company. They also have nice little perks like fishbowls (talks or performances by popular speakers or up-and-coming bands) and the holiday/summer party were fun.","Like I mention above, Amazon is a challenging place to work in recruiting. They have grown insanely fast over the last five years, so they have tapped the US and Canadian markets pretty hard already. Finding new engineering talent who seem qualified and haven't interviewed in the past is very difficult. They have unrealistic expectations on their recruiters that add unnecessary.  Everyone who works there is very serious about their job and has strong opinions. Most are good at listening to other people and making decisions based on data, but you need to be able to take critique and work with other people. People will push back on your ideas.  While Amazon is pretty competitive in the area of compensation/perks, I don't feel it is very competitive for it's level of company. By that, I mean if you compare them to the overall tech market, they are very competitive. However, the people who are considering Amazon are typically also looking at places like Facebook, Google, and Uber. The compensation/perks at those places are a definite step up from what Amazon offers, so even if you enjoy working at Amazon, it makes it difficult to stay there when you hear you can get a significant raise, work on equally awesome projects, and get all your meals free at a competitor.","Keep improving how you treat your employees. While I think Amazon is good, the other major tech players seem like they care more about their employee's happiness, which is why you see a lot more people leaving from Amazon to Google/FB/Uber than you see coming the other direction. Overall, I think it's a good place to spend a few years but hard to see why I wouldn't move on to another big name that will provide the same positive opportunities while also providing more perks.",3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2

It’s a beautiful campus (soccer and softball fields, sand volleyball courts, trails etc…). Microsoft also has a lot of products. It is one of the few companies where you can work on an OS, developer tools, database engines, cloud services and games. If you get tired of working on one product you can move teams to work on something entirely different. You also get the opportunity to work with really smart people who have the same passion and technical interests that you do. Building software is Microsoft’s business. It’s not an IT or hardware shop it is a software company.","Management is not honest or open. I found out about a change in my position\team structure by seeing an email distribution list. My manager at the time could not be bothered to tell me I had to make an appointment with him to find out. You can be surprised in your reviews. Very clique’ ish, if you are not in the same clique’ as you manager get out of that team and find a new one. There are way too many managers who can not write code, although they like to think they can.  Managers can be very demeaning to individuals. I had one manager tell me that the best management book he had ever read was a book on raising children. Even the current CEO, Satya Nadella, has made a similar reference. This is very insulting. I’m an adult you should treat me like one.  Microsoft is not an innovative company. When I joined the company the industry was reading books explain how Microsoft ships software. Of course the industry has passed Microsoft by and now Microsoft is not even mentioned in article that describe the direction the industry is taking.","Not sure if there is any advice to give to Microsoft management, because they never listen, but here it goes. Be open and honest. Stop wordsmithing. Example the old review model was known as a stack ranking, but it was always call “calibration”. It’s not, people are put in a stack from top to bottom. Calibration only happens when you have to make the review numbers fit a model. Hire managers that are courageous. There are too many bullies in the upper ranks, you need managers who can stand up to them. Too many managers don’t live the Microsoft values. For example they are not able to give bad news. Be honest where you are at as a company. Microsoft is not an industry leader, in some markets it is a legitimate contender, in others it is simply an also-ran. Respect the rank and file troops. Financial rewards are fine, but they only work in the short term. Too many directors/managers are too far removed from the very people who work really hard to make them successful.

Regardless of whether it's a smart business move, Microsoft has products all over the map. If you're unsure about what you want to work on or want to try something new, Microsoft is a great place for you. Changing teams is very doable.  2) Great place to learn to be a software engineer. I joined right out of college. Engineers at Microsoft are more battle-scarred than those at younger companies.  3) Stability. If you're looking for stability, look no further. Microsoft isn't going anywhere. Even most of those affected by the layoffs found other jobs within Microsoft.","1) Too big and too unfocused. It's too easy to feel like your work isn't significant due to the sheer volume of other stuff going on. A more lean, focused Microsoft would help engineers feel important.  2) Poor matching of college hires to teams. If you're joining right out of college, be very assertive about what you want to work on (that is, if you actually know what you want to work on). They won't put you where you want to be without a fight.  3) Business outlook. Microsoft is doing just fine but is struggling to gain traction in new and emerging markets.

The customer service satisfaction surveys are not contestable even when the customer writes that you were great but USPS or UPS was not.

Survey contesting wasn't possible after the fact either if you got a No due to political even though Amazon did later on decide political calls were able to be suppressed.

However, the things that cannot be controlled are things such as area wide power outages or internet outages that might not affect millions but does affect your area community. Amazon refuses to acknowledge those things as area wide issues.  Things such as the garbage truck gets tangled in the line and severs the fiber internet line for your community thus knocking you out of work.

I hear at other companies that there is a ceiling for technical types, but here there isn't. They have career stage setup all the way from Senior SDE, to Architect, Distinguished Engineer to Technical Fellow. Of course, extremely few people amongst the talented employees of microsoft make it to level beyond Architect, but that path is there. - In general, if you are pro-active, there is a lot of support you can get to learn how to grow and succeed at microsoft, in the form of mentoring.","- The review system is not fair, in the sense that the leadership team makes decisions based on their impressions of contribution of a team member, whereas your manager, and colleagues you work with on a project may know a lot better about your level of performance. Coupled with the brutal stack ranking system, and rewarding the top 20% the most, what this means is that you will get really burned if you think all you need to do is churn out great code, and work well with your teammates to release a good product. You need to actually spend time with leadership team, let everyone know what you are doing etc, so that you stay in the radar of the leadership team.  This also means that there are very driven, smart people who end up focusing more on career growth, rather than releasing a great product.  - Company is very big, so a fair number of employees are bound to be quite mediocre.

Some are in HR and some are managers. They take an interest in feedback and communicate well.,"Hired in one department but trained in others. All departments, inbound, stow, pick, sort, pack are judged by rate. In pick for example associates are to pick 100 items per hour in a 10 hour shift, in a 3 story pick area larger than a football field, regardless of the ridiculous pick path that is given to associates. The density of a pick path can very dramatically. If you make your 1000 items per shift you are left alone but fall below the 1000 per shift and be ready for punishment. Averages over several weeks are used to rate employees performance but be ready for verbal and written warnings if you don't meet their arbitrary goals. Managers say things will average out but that is not based on the reality of an actual associate. If you exceed rate per hour for months and months and then management changes things which causes your rate to drop you are pounced on. All that matters is rate at the expense of associates. Amazon has lost a lot of good people just because of the harassment by management and the physically brutal expectations of walking for 10 to 15 miles, or standing for 10 hours as a packer.","Develop software to save associates from the brutality of walking 10 to 20 miles per shift.

HR is in general useless and will not step in to help employees on these concerns. 2) Benefits are close to none. The company will make you feel you are a worthless piece of garbage via its self-critical culture (they take it too far), but somehow still give you a lot of stocks so your total compensation is still great. But you feel like a slave for our customers and newbies get burnt out by this. I got used to this as time went on but it requires a strong personality. 3) Intl divisions - especially Asia subs, are completely randomized and chaotic either in business direction or in mgmt capabilities as leaders - dont just focus on growth and make sure you have the right employee dev resources put in place and empower your HR people to actually do something.","1) Invest in Leadership development for your mgrs.

There once some leaked comments once a GM told his people that his associates are just monkeys in order to get the shipments out of the door during peak holiday season. that is a good example how NOT to lead.  2) Make some serious HR changes. your HR is useless. Empower them to step in and stop bad behavior when appropriate. HR should be a neutral, empowered group but I found my HR partners to be powerless and scared to step in even when thing are going wrong - e.g. some intl office we were in - employees were asked to keep working while renovations were going on. dusts/building material were floating in the air daily and some of my folks were getting nose bleeds.. Advice from HR? Pls don't make a big deal out of it.. ""have you heard of asbestos?"" sooner or later some class action suit will hit if these practices don't change. HR right now are just puppets.  3) Frugality culture is fine, but dont come acrss as cheap to the bone. Toss a bone here or there to your employees and they'll be much more upbeat in morale and work even harder for you.

DISCLAIMER: You'll get tired of it pretty soon though.","* This place scars you for life. Read more at the end of this section. * Forget your life, health and everything else if you want to be successful here. To the company, you're just a resource to be used till you're all used up and then discarded. That, they say, is the price of success. * If you're someone who likes your 7 hours of sleep a day, stay away. * If you're someone who has hobbies that take more than a few seconds of your time, stay away. * If you're someone who has a family that you'd like to spend more than a few seconds of a day with, stay away. * If you have friends who you want to talk to more than once a year, stay away. * If you're smart, stay away - you can land a job at a much better work place. The work here isn't technically challenging at all, it is challenging in the sense that you're woken up in the middle of the night and have to fix things however you can, however quickly you can, so that you can be in to work the next day. * If you think you'll learn how to write good code or design complex systems, think again - you're just going to fight fires and write hacky code to quickly patch up someone else's mess. The aim is just speed and secondly, something that works somehow, and the end result is an unprofessional and messy codebase, which even the worst coders in my class in college would've been ashamed of. * Their oncall system is probably the worst.  A NOTE TO THOSE WHO ARE ABOUT TO JOIN AMAZON, OR THOSE WHO RECENTLY JOINED: * If you can turn down your offer and continue interviewing elsewhere, I'd suggest doing that. * If you've got no other option, or if you've recently joined, give it a few months, don't assume things will improve - they never do. My first month was an excellent representation of the other 22 months I stayed there. * Keep coding on the side to keep up your design skills. I personally know so many people who were scared to interview at other places, since they felt they'd lost all skills. If you feel the same way, don't worry - some open source coding is good enough to bring you up to scratch. * Don't let their ridiculous stock vesting cycle trap you! You'll lose most of your stocks whenever you leave. * If you realize you're starting to have more headaches, or your blood pressure is beginning to get higher, or if you face any health issues whatsoever, just put in your papers. Those are the first symptoms that things are beginning to go downhill. The adrenalin junkie lifestyle is not for everyone and there's no shame in quitting. * This place scars you for life. I'm still suffering the after-effects, almost 3 years after I've left, and my health is slowly improving (thankfully) now. It also changes your mindset and how you react to things that are normal at a workplace. Less than two years there, and my instinctive reaction to a problem at work has become figuring out a hack, just focus on the extremely short-term and forget about the medium and long-terms. I've also realized I now had trust issues at work. I initially looked at teammates in my new workplace (one of the best companies to work for) as potential backstabbers.  I could go on and on, but long story short - STAY AWAY! You do NOT want to ever work here. Unless you don't appreciate your current employer - in which case, go work for Amazon for a year and return to your old workplace. After working for Amazon, anywhere else will seem like heaven!","I know it probably comes from Bezos himself, but as a company, Amazon must think at least a little about the long term.

Management says to voice opinions, but if you don't sing to their tune, then you will see the result in the infamous stack ranking.  The managers have too much power to game the system of year end reviews. Have seen multiple people take advantage of the system by going out shopping with manager after work, socializing in company events and then getting high rating even though they have not been able to perform their core work efficiently.  The culture fosters distrust among colleagues. For example, even if the manager is not present in a meeting, words gets to the manager somehow even after you made a comment and caveated it by saying that this discussion is strictly inside the meeting room only.  The management tries to manage by keeping informational silos with the employees and acts arbitrarily to do what is advantageous to them. For example, I have been in groups where promotions were never shared and kept a secret. If management wants to give you a good rating, they will share the feedback you have got from your business partners.If the management wants to give you a bad rating, then they will say that the policy is not to share the feedback.  The company will try to hire you down if you are coming from other company. The overall compensation is not good compared to many other companies, especially since they hire you in a lower position. On top of that, management does not give recognition to your past skills and you basically start afresh.  Overall, people who pays 80% weight on politicking and 20% on actual value added work will do good. If not, you will find the culture very negative. At the end of the day, the work needs to be done and the company has a huge pool of vendors for that.  Note: All groups are not bad places to work for.

You'd feel like a humble servant of the millions of Amazon's customers. - A lot of innovation, cutting-edge and magical. - A lot of open source technology is used in Amazon, which can be useful later in your career. - A lot of proprietary technology, so that you know why the open source variant doesn't work. - Distributed systems, algorithms, SOA - not a lot of folks in the industry push the envelope like Amazon does, not even Google! - Dealing with scale, if you work for a group which has a lot of scale. - Rapid iterations. You don't sit idle. You ship code almost every week - You operate what you own. So you get to talk to customers/users, developers, QA, support and datacenter engineers. You are the KING! - The top 10% of this company are among the best in the industry. - Good compensation, at least in some locales - Internal transfers are really easy, especially when you've already proved your mettle. Probably to curtail the already high churn and attrition in the company.","(... in no particular order)  Management: - You don't need people management skills to become a people manager here. Which means, an MBA with no experience of managing, developing and dealing with people can become a software development manager. - Most managers are non-technical. They will throw a lot of hand-wavy stuff at you and expect you to get the work done. - Most managers lack backbone. They would take things lying down and pass on all the grief to the engineers.  Culture: - Employees are NOT treated with respect. We are people, not resources for you to move around. - Management is extremely political, especially the ones who are low on technical acumen. They frequently use politics as a way out. - No perks, other than a crappy medical insurance package.  Engineering:  - Extremely aggressive deadlines leading to poorly written and sparsely tested software. - Engineers do 24x7 oncall. The oncall is also a build and release engineer. They are also the first ones to deal with the customers (aka hazards of end-to-end ownership). - Operations consume a lot of time. They also randomize entire teams. Most groups are unable to deal with this menace. In other words, if you're working on a feature, you may be asked to shelve it for the next 2 weeks to work on a customer impacting issue. - A lot of last minute requests. This is mostly because of the sheer number of adhoc requests from other software or operations teams, and because of lack of planning for such adhoc tasks.  Career growth/development:  - Performance reviews are not transparent. Everything is driven by your manager. The HR department is a mute spectator in most conflicts between the employee and the management. - YoY increments in compensation are low (5-6%) - Long-time employees are paid less than folks hired from the industry. ""Loyalty is not rewarded"" - this is from the official handbook. - No investment in career growth. If you're a star engineer, you'll probably have a career path, but if you're not, there's no mentoring.  Hiring:  - Poor hiring standards. Amazon's bar is nowhere compared to Google or Facebook. The company has devised weird, experimental strategies to hire engineers. The center where I used to work grew at least 200% in four years. The # of incompetent engineers has also grown at the same scale. Interestingly, when most other companies continue to improve, Amazon is following a downward trend, in-spite of their famous Bar Raiser program.","Fix the management, the people and the hiring standards and I'll come work for you again.",2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2

At Apple, you are not ""hired"", but rather, ""selected"", like a piece of a puzzle, to fit in with the rest of the team.  Apple focuses on developing you through the trials and tribulations in retail. Being good is simply not enough–so, when the opportunity provides itself to help you become the best, it is always taken. Your peers are there to give you feedback. You are there to implement it. Your leaders are there to do the same, but guide you (or lead you) through the process of growth, while ultimately helping you get to the next position in the store.  A lot of the skills I have learned here at Apple has bled over into my personal life. I am able to focus a lot more (and block out distractions as well, we know how busy it can get) on the things that matter.  I have learned to think creatively and strategically.  I have learned how to communicate passionately and effectively.  I have learned to empathize with upset customers and turn situations around.Even if I am unable to turn the situation around, I have learned to calm my inner self to the point where I do not lash out at customers. I am more vulnerable than ever now.  If you are looking for a great job, a job where you have another family that helps develop you, while making some great money and reaping some great benefits, then this job is for you. This job is NOT for you if you are not passionate, are not vulnerable, do not want to learn, or do not care about helping others grow.  This job is for the go-getters, the doers, the people who want MORE, the people who want to develop, reach new levels, bring others along on the journey (leadership) and learn technical skills/people skills that open your mind to a whole new level of thinking.","I know, I know, with the above post a lot of people will say, ""Oh, this guy must have drunk the Kool Aid.

So, a lot of times, when heading to work you might feel like ""Oh, I just work in the mall. Nothing to see here. Just regular customers.""  I can't lie, I have had those thoughts sometimes. But there are ways to help with that. Show up to work a little earlier than expected. maybe 30 minutes. Relax for a bit. get your mind wrapped within the atmosphere.  Because, truth be told, the job is incredibly demanding...but it's so rewarding.  Don't be dismayed that you work in a mall. You still work at Apple and you are still enriching lives. It's incredibly fun.  Questions.  Customer's will come in and ask the same questions. Over and over again. And over. And over. Don't get bored. Find new ways to creatively express what iCloud is. Find new ways to show customer's the differences between the iPhones, Macs, or iPads. Let them drive. Don't take over. give them that, and you'll see that they enjoy the interaction more.

For example, yes, you do in fact tell new hires that they'll need to unlearn bad habits from past employers. At least you could have the decency to own it. Calling out Comcast as an example was truly classy, but it was also valid criticism. Don't dish it out if you can't take it.

23302,startup_4,"Seattle, WA"," Jun 21, 2014",Current Employee , Senior Business Manager,Recipe for Burnout,"- Many smart people who are good to work with - Opportunity to work on interesting projects, at scale","My review is about what it's like to be a business contributor at Amazon. This could be a marketing manager, category leader, product manager, project manager, etc. I will begin with the assumption that great business contributors want to do two things: 'Produce New Ideas' (better ways of doing things, new initiatives), and 'Drive Change'. Now I'll explain why Amazon's environment is essentially hostile to both. The consequence for many business contributors is burnout.  ""High Standards"" has devolved into Endless Fault-Finding -- Amazon suffers from a somewhat unique culture of ""high standards"". Never have I seen a supposed corporate value become so abused. There is precious little innovation in Amazon retail over the last 5 years and much of this owes to the endless nitpicking masquerading as ""high standards"". Amongst executives especially, there is a competition as to who has the highest IQ. This is demonstrated by who has the most effective takedown of a proposed idea, which is usually distributed in the form of a document read during meetings. In this warped culture, an executive would expose himself as a ""naif"" by praising a proposed idea. Instead, ""clarifying questions' and critiques rule. A Simon Cowell impersonation contest ensues. What does this mean for new ideas? It means that to merely suggest a better way of doing things means to be attacked - ""Why didn't you propose this earlier? You've been working here for X years already"", ""Why isn't the team already doing this?"", ""You could do A, B, C, D differently, your analysis on ___ is sloppy and incomplete"".  ….Or their favorite- ""Get MORE data"". Executives don't understand how convoluted the process is of getting accurate data at Amazon because they always have someone to fetch it for them. Amazon not only does not use 3rd party analytics packages, they don't even have an effective proprietary system for dashboarding data or pulling metrics. Most of the requests are done by hand through SQL across a myriad of poorly documented tables in which the data fields are not well understood. Trying to understand what different fields means, requires you to file a ticket - which is sometimes never responded to. Once you prepare the data set, any minor variance in the data is justification, according to executives, that ""you don't understand the underlying dynamics of what you're proposing"". ""High Standards"" has become a tour de force of fault-finding and needless perfectionism that totally deters new idea development at Amazon. Why suggest a new idea or better way of doing things? You know you are signing yourself up for data pull after data pull, document after document, harangued at meeting after meeting. After the initiative is actually implemented, you will never be thanked for the contribution the initiative makes. Instead, other stakeholders will find fault with it, and complain to your manager, who will be all too receptive and that they ""have been concerned about these same issues for some time"". Sadly, this gives a glimpse as to why many business managers at Amazon end up doing bare minimum because being a change agent is filled with pitfalls and very few positives.  Executives do not Engage Business Mangers in Ways that are Productive --  Although mileage may vary on different teams, I believe, in general, Amazon values executives and engineers. Executives mistakenly assume they have all the judgment thats required, and all underling business managers are good for is supplying them with data so they can apply their ""brilliant minds"". Of course, they lack context for all the categories and channels that these decisions require, but that doesn't bother them. They respect engineers because engineers have a kind of knowledge they know they don't, and engineers can always retreat into arcane aspects of tech that are impenetrable to executives. I have never seen a company where executives so totally engage their subordinates at the wrong level. What I mean by this is executives are told to ""dive deep"" and understand the details- an impossible task when they manage dozens or hundreds of people. So what ends up happening is they attempt to micro-manage teams in areas of the business they simply DO NOT have command over. What they do NOT do, unfortunately, is take the time to ask questions of their various business manager to better understand the business, or engage at a high level and try to ascertain if there are significant business opportunities we are not addressing. That might add some value, but they don't do that. Instead, absent context, they launch into highly opinionated monologues on what we should be doing, or play ""gotcha"" with minor errors they spot in the document. You will quickly find out these are not mutual conversations but rather 1-way statements. The other favorite thing to do during business reviews is to not discuss the business, but discuss the layout, formatting, and descriptions in the document itself -- as though that is best use of people's time. Amazon executives enjoy raising their voice at subordinates and are the worst at listening I have ever seen at a major company. Listening is apparently not a valued skill. What transpires is Micro-Management without context. It is a pointless kind of engagement that adds no value. Worse, it squanders entirely the domain expertise of business experts that Amazon has brought on board. There could potentially be excellent synergy between the domain knowledge business contributors have and strategic mindset that executives have -- but that won't happen the way current interactions take place at Amazon. Managers are often indifferent towards major issues confronting the business but lash out in anger at seemingly minor details, a haphazard form of review that leave subordinates unable to understand exactly the priorities of the business.  Politics and Consequences --  Business contributors burnout at a blistering place at Amazon. In my group alone, almost HALF of the business headcount have left the team in ONE year. At the same time, most of the engineers and executives have remained. Business managers often don't have the tools to their job, with inadequate analytics and few methods to improve an ailing part of the business. One of the more unfortunate aspects, which further deters action, is that Amazon can be very political. Most teams are ""2 pizza teams"" - meaning they are self-sufficient. You can easily spend 90% of your time with your own team. But this means that other teams become RELUCTANT to collaborate. They have their own priorities and often don't need you for anything. Let's say you have a Project X which had a dependency that another team owns. When you approach them to make modifications to aid your department, they may well resent this attempted shift in priorities. Now the very manager who told you to deal with a dependency that another team manages, who pushed you to get this other team to change, also is the one who finds fault with you when the other team objects that your intervention is not appreciated. The manager will tell you to orchestrate change WITHOUT anyone balking, which I suppose is easy enough for a manger who himself does not orchestrate change, but largely reviews documents. Given that much has been written about Amazon's ""gladiator culture"", it is silly to think rank and file can go out into the environment and make change happen without ruffling a few feathers. Without adequate support of subordinates, employees will simply stop attempting to drive change with other teams. And many have. When I first joined Amazon, I was surprised how many business contributors avoided the inter-department negotiations necessary to move things along, now it's all too clear (note sometimes this push-back will come from one's own team- and management will be indifferent to the hostile team dynamics). Management has created a no-win situation for that kind of activity. One reason for this disconnect-- Managers themselves often focus on 'strategic initiatives' which have S-team buy-in so different teams have already prioritized that work. Managers who work on these initiatives experience harmony across teams, but can't seem to understand that other initiatives (which are not prioritized by the consumer leadership team company-wide) don't have the built-in support. So when they see there is tension, this contrasts with the smooth cross-team relations they are used to seeing. It's a kind of myopia that hampers cross-team collaboration, the kind that really requires teams to collaborate when it's not dictated from above.  Accomplishments are Lost in the Noise --  The emphasis on fault finding at Amazon culturally prevents the opposite at Amazon - to celebrate an individual or even a team's job well done. The consequence however is that there is little difference between a business manager who treads water versus one who swims a 100M record. Provided a business manger works effectively on a few projects that are deemed important by senior management, that is sufficient. The lack of recognition by management and executives for standout work has become the undoing of morale at the company for business contributors. This may be stereotypical, but engineers can often subsist on challenging work and peer recognition by other engineers. When business contributors go above and beyond, if their accomplishments are simply seen as another bullet point on a document or a brief mention at an annual review, there simply isn't enough incentive. You will always have some % of contributors who will plough forward regardless, but even for them it's a matter of time before the lack of recognition will have them seeking greener pastures.  The reviews saying Amazon is cheap with its employees are true. But they suggest Amazon withholds perks from employees which cost money such as snacks, or events, or bonuses. In truth, I feel like this matters, but not nearly as much as the fact that Amazon is stingy with things that don't cost money -- like recognition and support (support might be your manager vouching for your work rather than undercutting it at every opportunity when criticism is received from other teams or executives). Instead, Amazon goes to great lengths to diminish people's accomplishments, ignoring their successes, attempting to diffuse individual achievements across a team so as to prevent individuals from receiving credit (and critique the individual as ""selfish"" if they try to claim a hand in that success).  What would Valuing your Employees more Mean? --  Amazon's position in the market has allowed it to develop a sub-optimal culture, one that henpecks people for suggesting better ways of doing things, which goads him or her to ""prove it"" using inadequate tools, endlessly faults them, and then ultimately is indifferent towards the resulting improvement. It has management that, all too often, is unaccountable - that does not participate in collaborative exchanges with its team, but rather reads documents and directs ""feedback"". Management is largely indifferent to team progress that doesn't align with S-team goals, but much of the company's success owes to progress in these other areas.  I don't think the answer is ""free beer"" or company lunches. It may one day dawn on Amazon leadership that finding ways to SUPPORT promising ideas and efforts are just as important as critiquing them. That it's management's job to ensure employees have what they need to do the job: that means adequate analytics and tools, assistance in gaining cooperation of other teams, ensuring effective dynamics on the team itself, ensuring quality processes and removing obstacles… even something trivial like making sure that is actually possible to book a meeting room without 5 days notice. That management has value to add to the team, and there is more to do than disappear and work on 'strategic' initiatives. Ultimately, I think valuing employees means respecting that business managers are domain experts and it is their expertise that you are hiring them for, their knowledge and judgment, that the value of that team comes from matching executive strategic insight with it. That requires management & executives to be humble enough to ask questions and have collaborative exchanges and God forbid, ask what a business manager's judgment is on a particular issue when there are different options available. To recognize that business contributors are there for more than simply providing details or fetching data. Great workers may want compensation, but I think they want recognition of their contribution and their abilities more than anything. Providing that costs nothing, only a shift in mindset.  Absent any change, Amazon's environment is a recipe for burnout for business contributors. The company will keep hemorrhaging quality people, having them leave not long after they've begun to master the learning curve in the organization, replacing them with new people who will follow the same cycle- preventing the company from benefitting from its mid-level personnel. More work for recruiters I'm sure. Lack of executive concern towards attrition of business contributors will have a cost- one they may find out too late. The tragedy is the situation is reversible - but indifference, owing largely to Amazon's dominant position in the marketplace, will likely prevent it.",See above,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,33

Luckily, at least that's over. - Performance Review and Salary: I have had many reviews so far and it always seems subjective.

Business keeps asking for projects to be built while we don't have enough resources and don't even care about operational support. They just want things to be done for their own promotion, then get promoted, and leave the burden behind. Engineers are quoted on their words about ""rough/initial"" estimation and got pressured onto that ""promises"" to get things done. Inexperienced engineers make that amateur mistakes all the times and burn themselves out. Engineers like me stay in the department because of promises about promotion, different and interesting project, but of course pay raise is kinda out of question but only for a very few people.

He has to learn everything, plays nice with his mentor although that mentor is not even helpful. - Managers and some engineers tend to present the Amazon's problem in a very engineer way: it is not perfect and very challenging but there will always be room for improvement and you can contribute to that. Sure, it's possible, if only you work their days and nights, weekend included to get your work done and achieve those goals.  You probably ask why I am still working there after so many complaints I made above. Well, I love my teammates. They are some of the best engineers I have had a chance to work with. They are all moving on now. I am the last man standing. Prepping for the interviews now. If you are working for Amazon, move on, NOW.

Every product is lovingly designed, and it shows in the attention to detail. As a Genius, someone who was responsible for troubleshooting and taking apart these products, even on the inside many design details came to light to show the care that was put into each machine. Depending on where you worked, each store brought together such a wide variety of employees, from kids just out of high school working a summer job to the guy who has been using Macs for ten years and knows it inside and out... the benefits are good and you meet so many amazing people.","Its too bad the retail management is absolutely terrible. When I was in training to become a Mac Genius, our trainer referred to them as turning Apple into ""Gapple"" because so much management had such little knowledge about computers and came from retail environments. Our store manager was a college dropout (albeit from Stanford) who originally came from Starbucks and had never been a manager before. Two of our assistant managers also came from Starbucks, and one came from Wal-Mart. Our Senior Assistant manager encouraged a young employee that college was ""pointless"" and she should drop out to become a creative. The retail job used to be very different with much better benefits, but sadly has now turned into just another mall jobs, just prettier on the outside than others. Benefits were slowly stripped, from turning a quarterly bonus into a ~$.75 raise for everyone, to the removal of the ""free iPod"" for every employee plan, to just making the job seem less like working for a cool company that cared about you and well, just another job.","I would remind retail management specifically that their job isn't just about making their quarterly bonus by pushing metrics and hiring energetic kids to sell. The old guard, the people who originally made the store fun, were all pushed out by management because they wern't sheep who would bend to the desires of management.

Amazing talks at Microsoft Research, mainly by invited guests. Huge company so there is the possibility to change roles quite easily. The pay is quite good especially because the main location is in WA. Great bus that brings you all over campus. Some new cool Microsoft devices.","My main criticism is that it is not a company that values women in the workplace. I have not observed women getting promoted and women from technical fields are rarely being hired. Teams remain disproportionately male even compared to recent statistics from Google and other competitors. Little effort is made to proactively recruit women in technical positions. Managers from my division regularly and openly discredit women. They bully them (from my personal experience). It feels like Anchorman over there. The maternity/parental benefits are BS. I took them and it cost me a poor review (I was doing great before and in all prior reviews).  If you are in my situation, know that a lot of tech companies are proactively hiring women, publishing their statistics as cause for change, and rewarding women for their good technical work. The underlying belief in other companies is that women have equal capacity to be technical and do technical work. This is not the case at Microsoft. Credit is frequently given to male co-workers on the basis of their arrogance and posture. The presumption is that technical contributions in collaborations come from men. This is promoted by managers at many levels. For instance, women are frequently required to justify more of the technical claims on patents then their male counterparts on similar patents. The presumed inequality is part of everyday engagements.  Real equal opportunity teams may exist in the company. Just be sure to interview your future Microsoft colleagues and understand the culture you are going into. I have excellent offers in other places now, and I am taking the one that best fits my personality and values. I know I will have a great impact there. I just wished I had moved out sooner from an environment that was toxic for my health.  There is no collaboration possible, and unless you are a very vocal person and snarky to a fault, more arrogant people steal the credit for your work. I have struggled with this lack of collaboration and very competitive atmosphere. I was hoping that with the Nokia integration, a more collaborative culture would influence Microsoft leaders, but unfortunately it did not happen and all of those guys got fired anyway.  Regarding the interview process, the recruiter really tries to lowball you compared to other companies. This was my experience interviewing initially and then later interviewing internally. Crap tactics like acting baffled and surprised at basic packages offered by many of their competitor companies are the norm. Can they understand more collaborative techniques and work together on a good package? They do not reward PhDs. They do not reward the caliber of the institution you're coming from. It is because most of the management lack graduate education and believe education is useless (I heard it many times at work).  A minor thing, no free food, and food becomes quite expensive if you have only 20minutes to eat and need to eat in the local expensive cafeteria in the Commons (about 10-15$ a lunch). Something to budget.  The culture is really engraved in every manager who has been there from the start. Of course, you can find an excellent team (it does exist!) and if the work is a good fit, go for it. Be sure to probe the team's culture and get to know who will be your skip level.","Maybe another style of leadership needs to take place, less bullying and more communication would be a first step.

If you have a heartfelt opinion that you think would benefit the team and the business (which I vividly remember Apple as a culture ENCOURAGING THIS) you're beaten down- they accuse you of being negative, lacking social tact (quoted- seriously!) and any chances for advancements quashed. The leadership team picks favorites and fosters this strange environment that makes you feel unwelcome, muffled and worthless. They seem to not like older people, particularly ladies- which I think is due to the feelings of one manager specifically who is quite obviously a misogynist.

Some of my personal pros consist of the following:      - Incredibly smart people     - Never-ending opportunities to be innovative     - Constantly creating new things     - Educational - you learn a lot working here, and there are endless opportunities to move around between teams in order to develop and grow     - Company is a not afraid to take risks if it will provide a fantastic customer experience     - Ability to make things happen quickly - If there's something you want to change, go for it!     - Diverse workforce - there is a huge initiative pertaining to this right now, and it's exciting","Let's face it, Amazon is not for everyone. If you are someone who likes to be complacent, enjoys knowing exactly what your day-to-day is going to be and prefers to operate under rules and guidelines, then you will not enjoy Amazon. This isn't to say that either preference is ""right"" or ""correct"", but it definitely accounts for many of the people who have decided to no longer continue their employment here. Even so, there are some cons that I can personally provide as someone who does enjoy working for the company in general:      - No positive affirmations. Although this is not absolutely necessary, it would be nice to experience every once in awhile     - Poor work-life balance usually occurs during your first year here. However, most people are able to get in a groove where they can figure out how to correct this.     - Management quality is incredibly inconsistent here. Some are very strong managers, but there are many who are also very weak. This is due to the scaling that has taken place which has resulted in very strong ICs moving into management roles when they are not well-prepared to manage people.     - Perks do not compare to Google or Facebook. I'm not in it for the ""perks"", but I could see how this could be a deterrent or a disappointment for some people.","Find a way to effectively prepare new people managers for their roles.

I was too...at least for the beginning of two months. So, I don't need to repeat the good things about working for Google here. But, remember, all the good things are mostly posted by ""software engineers"". They are like king of the world in Google versus operation engineers (including me) are like slavers of the king.","Google, fortunately, is the worst company I have ever worked for. It attracts so many talent people to work for this company, but in fact, the only give software engineers the special treatment. I've seen so many great engineers in operation team were treated like nothing.  1. management sucks My manager is the root cause that every engineer suffers. He is the best politician I have ever seen in my life. Ever since he promoted to be a manager, he started to play all the dirty games among us. He spent $20 mil per year on some equipments which melt down network connectivity so many times every month. He claimed that the equipments would save Google for 10 millions per year, but in fact, we spent a lot more work hours on trying to solve the problems these junks caused. The main problem is, there is no test base for these junks. Aren't we supposed to test all the equipment before we implement or even purchase them? Not these junks... how does it happen? pick ur guess! How about we go the manger above him. Too bad.. the upper manager is his buddy. There is no complain or any bad thing would ever leak out through these 2 layers of managers. They cover everything up very well. In fact, one of the manager's jobs should ensure the fairness. Well... ""fairness"" is NEVER been seen at this team.  2. politics tricks My manager has this policy: all the engineers under level III can not talk to the engineers above level IV. Well.... before I join google, I thought anyone could talk directly to anyone, even to CEO. But my manager fired a person who asked questions to a level IV. His recently move was - promoted two of his favorites to be managers and directly reported to him. You know what it means? He just promoted himself since there are two managers reporting to him now. That was the exact trick his upper manager did a couple years ago. Now... there are 3 levels of management under one director. How does this director allow this happen?? well.. that's the politics. So, when the new engineer join the team, how many levels above him?? It's IMPOSSIBLE that you get promoted if there is one new layer added. Most likely, you got downgraded every year!!  3. STEALING/CHEATING I've never seen so many cheating cases ever since I graduated from college, but here, at Google. We have two level IV engineers responsible for designing networks with one stealing ideas/credits from the other one's work!! And this cheating is permitted by the upper manager!! How did it happen? well... the managers playing the games. The two (now three) levels managers ensures that none of outside team could work with the talent engineer alone. When they steals, those seniors all lined up and the upper manager would give pressure down to turn in the design and the credits. Whoever on the same side of this level IV engineer would suffer a hard time and have bad reviews from those managers. So, we watched the stealing and cheating happening every day but no one dare to say anything.  <to be continued>","I thought Google was not a place for the politician to play games with every day.

13686,startup_4,"Seattle, WA"," Sep 22, 2017",Current Employee , SDEII,Good work-life balance and managers care your career growth.,"1. I see many people saying Amazon uses employees in crazy ways. That's not true at least to me or to any one I know. It really depends on the individual employees to maintain the work-life balance. In my org, no one is forced to work a minimum of certain number of hours. You control your own pace as long as you deliver on time. I probably work overtime (> 8 hours/day) once every few months. I was still able to be promoted to next level in less than two years. 2. Management is really a hit or miss. And this is true to ALL the companies I believe. When you have a healthy management chain up to VP level as I do, your manager, skip level manager care about you as an individual contributor. 3. Minimum politics you have to hear about. At least among the SDEs I know, there's no politics in their work. 4. You are the owner. Instead of having multiple people owning same project like what I've experienced in other tech companies, at Amazon you are the owner of your project. You get all the credits for the good things you've done and no one can take it away from you. You own the COEs when you make mistakes, learn and grow from your mistake is a very healthy way to your growth (and promotion). 5. Trust me, as long as you are capable, Amazon is the place for you to shine. If you are not that solid on your skills, learn in the hard way. You will be very capable and confident even if you decide to try other career opportunities. Amazon is not a good fit for you if you are not capable, not curious on learning. You will feel there's no work-life balance since you cannot deliver.","1. Still we do not provide free lunch. But comparing to the company growth (stock), do you still care about 200 bucks for lunch every month? Also, you know nothing is free unless you earn it. This is super helpful if you want to grow to a leader or start your own business. Do not be tricked by just free stuff and feel like contributing your whole life to the company which just treats you a little better. 2.

Another Con I've noticed is the managers not truly taking the time to get to know their associates even if they may change roles eventually. I think it's important to show your employees not only that you are running the show, but that if they need to speak with you one on one that you will at least be able to address them by name.",I would like to see Managers get on the same page as far as communication between each other when changes to procedures/policies are made. Maybe developing an email group per FC that is specific to changes within that particularly facility that requires immediate communication can be created so everyone is on the same page even if managers are changed.,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4

45461,startup_2,"Austin, TX"," Mar 12, 2013",Former Employee , AppleCare Manager,"Great at first, but the culture took a nose dive over the years","- At least when I first started, the culture was amazing. Creativity was valued and prized. You were taught interesting things, and given projects that tickled your brain if you were interested. - The people were, and still are, some of the most amazing people you'll ever work with. - The managers who are good are absolutely brilliant, amazing, and inspiring. You'll want to jump off a cliff for them. - The onsite benefits are pretty rocking. Cafeteria, very nice gym, lovely campus, onsite Toastmasters group (at least while I was there), various employee organizations and clubs, etc. - There's a lot of growth, so if you can play the politics game, you have a bright future ahead of you","As I continued on in my career at Apple, the company grew up and became more corporate. What does that mean? Fewer people got promoted from within (preferring instead to get people form the outside, people with MBAs, etc.) - As good as the benefits are, there were some serious lacks (example: No paternity leave, no paid leave for adoption, no sabbaticals, etc.) - Very few managers (and certainly almost no upper managers) care about the customer. They care about the number, but not about the actual customer. - The pay is okay at best. They brag that they're solidly average. This seems counterintuitive for one of the richest companies in the world. Value your human capital. - You do have to play politics. Which often translates to keeping your mouth shut. Anger the wrong person and you may as well quit because your career there is over. - A lot of the skills they teach aren't transferrable. Instead of certifying people in recognized brands (PMP, ASTD, etc.), they prefer to do their own certifications in house, which don't mean anything anywhere else.","There's a certain amount of brainwashing that you start to believe as an Apple employee. Namely, that because you work at Apple, there is no other company anywhere that is possibly even a tenth as awesome and hip and reliable as Apple - if you ever have the audacity to leave, every job for the rest of your career will be worse. It isn't true, but this attitude prevents Apple from caring as much about their employees as they could (and should). True, the benefits are great, but the culture definitely suffered in the time I was there. A few things I would look at:  - Rethink how you want the culture to be. Do you want people to have the freedom and creativity to make things better for coworkers and the customer, or do you want them to say ""Yes Sir"" to the Powers that Be, sit down, and be quiet? - Invest in employees, both in terms of their professional and personal development - Take a hard look at the managers that you hear are terrible. If a manager has a reputation for being awful, you should probably work on managing them out, not just proving them around to different teams. This isn't the Catholic church. - If you see a drastic change in peoples' behavior, try asking them what's wrong, rather than assuming that they've suddenly become bad employees. - Value your top performers. Keep them challenged. The fastest way to make a top performer your worst performer is to let them get bored.",4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,11

Needless to say, these include the cost of ""perks"" shown at a exaggerated rate and some components which are never realized. Whereas in off-campus recruitment they make reasonably good offer (often more than double, triple the amount offered to college hires of same level) to get a candidate, even if it maybe for test-engineer position.

Autonomy, independent thinking and ownership are encouraged here better than any other place that I know of. Amazon is a great place for builders and if you enjoy building things (robots at home, software at work, the works...) - then you will love working here.  As you will hear a lot of Amazonian's say ""there is scale and then there is Amazon scale"". I do not know of any other place that provides the cusp of physical scale and computing scale that Amazon provides. Physically moving goods across the world based on some person clicking a buy now button on the website - and doing it a very large number of times very day - brings with it some very interesting (including several unsolved) problems. it is a lot of fun to work on such problems.  Amazon is also a place that rewards diversity of thinking and approach. That has brought together a whole bunch of very interesting and smart people. I learn a lot every day that I show up at work. Amazon also has one of the most flexible internal move policies - so it is super easy to find something within the company that you are interested in working on and start working on it!  It is a very fast paced environment where something is happening all the time. Never a dull moment. That includes spirited white board discussions, quick team stand-ups and some noisy Friday evenings :)","The speed at which Amazon is growing resonates across the company.  This has had some downside in terms of ""big company"" features showing up at work. Sometimes there is process that builders may not enjoy as much. There is a lot of active push-back against unnecessary process and the good part is that at Amazon - it does change things ... but still - it feels like a ""big company"" sometimes.  Another aspect of having a fast moving builder culture with a lot of smart people is that it can be overwhelming at times. Sometimes I have felt that things are moving too fast and I have to play catch up.","Please do not give in to the pressures of the stock market or analysts. Amazon's strength is to think, invest and build with a long term perspective. Not many people get it - and it is ok. Most of us work here for that exact reason and we know that we are making big impacts. So please do not start thinking too much about of profitability and keep working towards the long term!",3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,1

I was used to working 15 hour night shifts with all manual labor as a manager because they decided to run so lean and send everyone home in order to break records. As a manager I got a 20 minute lunch break because we were even working during lunch sometimes with no breaks. I graduated college at 165 pounds and with 9 months of Amazon I got down to an unhealthy 137 due to a lack of time to eat and being thoroughly exhausted when I got home and just wanting to sleep. I was hired with a class of 14. I was the first to leave and then everyone else followed shortly behind me cause they had enough of Amazon's workplace etiquette as well as the lack of upper management. That facility currently has 3 of our 14 original hires and all 3 of them would quit tomorrow, but moving is expensive and some people can't afford to find another job. I don't care what the salary is at Amazon because you will not have time to spend your money, you will become unhealthy, and both your personal life and social life will fall apart.

11618,startup_4,"Edgerton, KS"," Feb 18, 2018",Former Employee , Tier I Associate,Ins and Outs of MKC4,"These are not all pros, but more general knowledge you should know when starting at MKC4 (Amazon location in Edgerton, KS). This information is for blue-badge members who are full-time.  1: Starting pay is higher than most general education jobs (almost double the current minimum wage) which starts at $13.00/hr. Pay increases ever 6 months  2. On your official start day (and if you have never worked a job that requires you to be on your feet 90% of the time), prepare for this. Tennis shoes are affordable, but will not fend well on your feet for the first month while you adjust. An investment in Timberland work shoes (around $90-120) are worth the expense, and I found them to be durable, and last at least a year.  3. Understand your benefits: First and foremost, understand that your schedule is like a contract, meaning the hours that you are schedules must be worked, or supplemented with your benefit hours. Personal Time Off (PTO), UPT (unpaid time), VTO (voluntary time off), MyLeave and Vacation are all ways you can make up hours that you may need to miss due to whatever reason.  -PTO: 48/hrs per year, granted with 10/hrs on the first paycheck of employment or first paycheck of the new year, followed by 3.58/hours for 10 pay periods to follow, with 1.1/hrs on the 12th pay period. These hours can be used at any time. Amazon suggest that you save PTO hours to use during PEAK season (Oct-Dec), as sales are increased, resulting in longer work days and mandatory overtime. -UPT: 80/hr per year. UPT is granted in 20/hour increments at the start of each quarter (Jan 1, April 1, July 1, Oct 1). UPT is meant for emergency purposes, but can be used as needed. (If an associate used UPT, that will negatively affect their VCP, which will be covered later). -VTO: is offered by upper management when the labor cost due to lack of orders needs to be reduced. AA's (Amazon Associates) are able to sign up for VTO at the start (or prior day if offered through the HUB, which is Amazon's online employee portal) in which they will be able to leave mid-shift (or whatever time upper management deems fit) without the need to use UPT, PTO. -MyLeave: is a resource that can be used if AAs need to be absent from work for long periods of time. They must be approved before hand. -Vacation time: 48/hrs a year. Full-time employees receive 1.53/hrs of vacation time per pay period. Vacation time must be approved by upper management, and cannot be used at any given moment like UPT or PTO.  ***Note: Amazon is firm on the policy of attendance. If you cannot make a shift, it MUST be covered either by PTO, UPT, VTO, or vacation if approved. If an AA goes negative on their UPT, it is an automatic dismissal. Be very cautious about our hours. I know it may seem acceptable to use hours that are available to you, but do not risk your employment due to going negative. Save save save your hours.  4: The days are extremely long. Most shifts are 10 hours long per day, with 4 days a week (during regular season, peak season is 60 hours per week). Amazon gives it's AAs (2) 15 minute paid breaks (actually 10 minutes with 5 minute walking time to and from your location). Example of my shift:  0730 - 1000 - Work 1000-1015 - Break 1015-1230- Work 1230 - 1300 - Lunch 1300-1530- Work 1530-1545- Break 1545-1800 - Work  5: Departments: A break down of each department:  Pick - this is a department to be in if you are comfortable driving PIT (vehicle in which to retrieve items). Mind you PIT can mean going 100+ft in the air to retrieve an item, so if you are not good with heights do not do Pick.  IC/QA: If you are an introvert and do not mind driving PIT, this is for you. Like pick IC/QA using PIT to tally inventory throughout the FC (fulfillment center). It's a slower paced position, best for those who are not super speedy.  Dock - Very physical department. Mostly being aTetris player by putting boxes into Trucks so they will fit and maximize space.  Inbound: This department receives items into the FC. They drive PIT, separate items to be stored, and other task. Like IC/QA, this department runs a bit slower.  Outbound/Pack department: This department is to place items to be shipped into boxes. This is the fastest department in the whole FC, and requires a rate of 70 unites boxed per hour. Department is good for those who like a fast-paced environment.  5: VCP: Variable Compensation Package is a bonus plan Amazon gives AAs who show up for their shifts and do not use UPT, and if the FC is meeting it's goals more than expected: -Attendance: if you show up to all your shifts(or covered them with vacation or PTO) and do not use UPT, you will receive a 4% bonus for the month. Example: You work 100 hours in the month, took no UPT, and make $13.00/hr, you would receive an addition $52.00. -Building Too Plan: If an FC is functions 105%+ to plan (meeting it's goals by 5% or more than expected), AAs will receive an additional 4% bonus. Mind you UPT is not calculated for Building Too Plan, so if you use UPT but the building does 105%+ for the month, you will receive this bonus. ***During Peak Season, VCP moves from a potential 8% to 16%.  6: If you like a longer 'weekend', choose either front half or back half shifts when selecting. These shifts run 4 days straight with 3 days off (during regular hours(non-peak).

You've seen the site, and you've seen how things like FireTV and Kindle are at best at-parity with similar competitive products. There's no daring in the design here. Good enough is well more than enough.  And in AWS, which badly needs intelligent and exceptional design, there are limitless opportunities but an unlimited amount of increasingly cumbersome bureaucracy to hack through.

If you're right out of college, this might be the place for you, but that's mostly because you wont have much work experience to compare it against.","1) the job I got is not the job I thought I was getting:   As an engineer, with engineer in the title, and over 10 years of experience, I really thought I would get to do more engineering. Unfortunately, the job is really about 50% business analyst and 20% project management, and 30% engineering. You are expected to own every aspect of your project, regardless if anyone else actually does. Also, you're told you have the opportunity to choose the team you want to be on, but for me, that choice was removed at the last minute.  2) bad management, bad leadership - all managers are expected to be individual contributors which is basically another way of saying that they aren't particularly good at either, and do not have time to devote to both roles. Also, be prepared for mansplaining.  3) more money than sense: gobs and gobs of money are being thrown around. there's basically an offsite every other week. Nevermind about work, deadlines, or being competent, it's more important to go glassblowing. The pay is nice, in fact, its the best feature about the place.  4) the company that wants to connect the world would rather loose talent than have remote workers. no, seriously. say you're on a team, and your team decides to move to another office thats like 1 hour away. you are kicked off the team and put on another team. what sense does that make? new mom wants to wfh? not allowed.  Seriously, it's called skype, people.  5) and speaking of teams, the team structure is completely whack. instead of having a core group of people I work with on many projects, I have a different group of people I work with on each project. a completely different set of swe, pm, ds, and de for each project. This completely limits our ability to grow more efficient with each project, let alone build any sort of a professional relationship.  6) you're not allowed to fix things that are legit broken. I've only been here a short time and have already had to suffer fools who prefer poorly designed metrics with political bs to actually measuring things properly. bug 1 told not to fix it - too big to fail, bug 2, never got fixed by other team, bug 3, too high profile to fix. seriously? why not just admit all your metrics are wrong?  7) people care more about performance reviews than actual performance. no really, if I hear the phrase make ""an impact"" I will vom. What this really means is not ""do good and useful work"" which is how it might be interpreted, instead it means that you should very little on the very high profile projects, and then post it everywhere, to make sure people NOTICE. Also, keep a log of your work so that you can share it with your absentee manager come review time - otherwise, he (yeah I said he) likely will have no idea what you worked on or why. But, instead of this being a meaningful signal, it just becomes more noise.","separate managers from IC. some of the best people I have ever worked for were not programmers.  stop focusing on impact, it sounds like a colon and its utterly meaningless  if it's broken, fix it. if your metrics change as a result, deal with it.  build a real team structure, and provide some actual leadership.  focus on programming for real reasons.

Workplace dress was warehouse-casual with the typical restrictions. Bottled water was free.","Summary: Extremely low pay. Asbestos in the building and other hazardous working conditions. Bizarre phone policy. Irrational & hostile management practices.  Extremely low pay. Worse if you are a temp or seasonal employee. Amazon pushes the boundaries of legality by routinely hiring for the holidays, strongly suggesting that you'll be converted into a full-time employee once the business of holiday settles down, and then once you work through their last big sale of the season, they'll let you go and say that they don't need you anymore. Microsoft was sued by temps for similar practices and won and Amazon's similar practice is underhanded and really hard on morale.  Serious health & safety hazard in the form of ASBESTOS. There was an announcement during December 2014 work shifts that asbestos had been found in the building as contractors were still working and while we were all there on our shifts. Nothing was done to secure the safety of the Fullfillment Center teams working in the building at the time. I don't know how they got away with it.  Break room, bathrooms, & staff lockers on opposite ends of the warehouse, not centralized, which effectively impeded staff access to rest on their legally scheduled breaks.  Invasive, bizarrely paranoid phone policy: You will not be permitted to work unless you allow security to make a log of your phone number and phone’s electronic ID even though you must leave your mobile in your staff locker, on the far side of the warehouse.  Overall, Amazon's policies at the Distribution Center at Crafton are right out of dystopian science fiction movie, like in Harry Potter when the Death Eaters took over Hogwarts. It is a very unhealthy work environment. The US Dept. of Labor should take a deep look into this business, from the working conditions to the finding of asbestos in the building while staff was working at Crafton at the end of 2014. Avoid this place like the plague unless you're absolutely desperate for work.","Raise pay to meet the extreme demands of the job. Pittsburghers are hard workers who provide good value as employees. You're having a hard time filling those ""instant hire"" positions, even in this less-than-optimal economy, because the pay is unacceptably low for the work you’re asking people to do, your corporate policies are ineffectively rigid, your hiring practices border on fraud, and your willful disregard for staff safety is despicable.

If you get on a good team they become like a second family (which is good because work life balance can be bad - see cons).  Fair and reasonable time off -- 3 weeks vacation to start, with an extra week at 6 years, and another at 12, 10 sick days, 2 floating holidays, plus 8 company holidays. Many managers are willing to be flexible if you need a half day, or run out of sick time to let you make it up in other ways.  Commute options are good - free parking, complimentary bus pass, plus company run shuttle service (The Connector)","New CEO is taking things downhill fast by getting rid of test teams. Quality of internal releases has been getting worse for the last 6+ months with no sign of getting better.  They tout positive work life balance, but if your product is at all behind, which happens often, you'll be working more hours than you can imagine. You don't earn comp time, so you have to just suck it up if they say you need to work a weekend.  If you get an unjustified poor review you have little to no recourse. If you happen to get on a bad team, or a team with ineffective managers who won't stand up for you, you are screwed. Good luck trying to transfer, because other teams will be wary due to the review.  Re-orgs happen ALL the time. This can make it incredibly difficult to have any sense of stability in your role, because you will regularly have a new manager.","The July 2014 layoffs were some of the most poorly handled and disrespectful moves I've ever seen. Many high performing people were laid off via a secret algorithm, leaving teams fractured and without the people they needed to complete valuable projects. What were you thinking?  If you treat your employees with respect and dignity you keep morale high, and keep people loyal.

If you newly join the company, you will spend quite some time doing the out-dated technologies. - ""Factory"", ""assembly line"" style process: this company is smart enough to ""streamline-lize"" its software development into something similar to Ford's assembly line. Working in that procedure gives you a strong feeling that you are one replaceable piece on it. - Management tries to get ""most mileage"" out of you: the management will try to make you work hard, overtime (while not explicitly say so to leave ""evidence"". One time I saw the manager explicitly wrote ""do more with less"", meaning getting more done with less people, in his commitment. Another time I heard the management using ""get enough mileage out of people"". They would make aggressive planning, use progress tracking software, status report meetings to force you into work over time. Not only that, during work it's highly intense, I had to make sure the previous scheduled tasks are made progress, and timely respond to boss' emails of ad-hoc tasks. Sometimes I need to switch between 5 desktop servers to run different tasks to get my assignments done. Looking back, every year there made me age 3-4 years. - Selfish culture. It boosted a culture that everybody try to strive to get what's within his own boundary done. And the company values the winner from internal competition (as the company is so big, upper management doesn't have time to judge who's right, so the simplest way I guess, is to see who's won out). From lower level, that means the peers just don't collaborate, but undermine each other. From bigger teams perspective, it's the fight between partners, and result in endless re-orgs. - Information control. The mid-management gives exactly information that you need to work on your piece of work. You don't know next reorg, you don't know the direction of the project. - ""Precision Question Answering"". There's this poisonous ""communication tool"" within Microsoft called ""Precision Question Answering"", it essentially trains people into using robotic-style conversations, so that the management can get the important information in the fastest way, and peers can challenge each other to fix logic errors in the details, at the cost of enjoying human-like collaboration between colleagues. - Compensation is terribly below the industry average level.",,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2

23137,startup_4,"Seattle, WA"," Aug 6, 2014",Current Employee , Operations Manager,A nightmare called Amazon Web Services,"Let us start with Amazon first and then with AWS. Amazon has this unique method of hiring. When there is a fire at Amazon and a dire need to hire, you will be immediately called for interviews and the whole interview process is expedited within weeks and you will also get an offer the next day you are interviewed. After applying for 4 years consistently I got my first call and then got called onsite right away and then an offer within 24 hours. I understood they needed a person on board very badly. Because it is Amazon, you will take the offer right away without thinking and plus the offer is so lucrative that you will just take it. Don’t be fooled with the stock options they offer as a part of the hiring package. Ask for more base salary or joining bonus. Average tenure at amazon for an employee is 1.5 years and stock options mature in 3rd and 4th year and hence you don’t see a single penny of it. Amazon pays you high but takes away your personal and family life. It is a place where everyone tries to prove they are right, even at the cost of other colleagues. So it is a rat race, where everyone tries to outsmart other at any cost. In the end people are very exhausted and look for other options. The office politics gets to you if you believe that hard work is the only means to progress in your career. Not many people know that amazon has this unique culture of laying off 10% of the work force every year irrespective of what you put in. So your relationship with your manager and other managers also will matter when it comes to review. Also, at amazon, anyone can write a review about you at any time, which will count towards your final performance review. So you have to watch your back constantly and have to be people smart and also work smart. This is not easy because even if you put in 120% you may not be in the best books with others because you did company’s good and in doing so, you stepped over someone in some way, who will write a review about you and to which you have no visibility to. So what you will see in your review will always be a surprise. If a decision is made to let you go per the 10% lay off rule, then they will give you 100 excuses and reasons of not performing. Except if you join in the last 3 months of the year, you are in for a review. I joined in September and in 15th week of my service, I was told that I am a part of the performance improvement program, which is a sophisticated name for the 10% people, who are walked off on any day the manager wants. The guard comes with a box and takes your tag and computer and you walk with an embarrassment. The culture is so rough that you hardly make any good friends at work because everyone is constantly thinking you are being nice but not sure if you will write a decent review.","Coming to AWS supply chain group. This group is nothing but laid off/struggling workforce of Dell, who have pulled each other into AWS. The whole group is a big mess as people come and leave in few months. Here the work culture is even worst that the amazon retail groups. The team is small, the work is loads, the ups and downs in business are huge because of which planning almost always goes wrong and you never know how that bad planning affects your work and you are made a scape goat of the events that were beyond your control. Someone somewhere is constantly counting the strikes against you and you will see that in your review or some other way when you finally walk off from AWS. The whole company runs on excel sheets with no ERP system that is strong enough to give visibility to people. So there is constant guessing and errors in what you communicate. Even if this is happening, you should be able to prove that you are smart and good at all times. There is a culture of writing a white paper. Any time something goes wrong you write a 1 pager and publish to the group. The management believes in churning papers, which no one really reads in future but you need to write them for proving your point or to cover of the mess that happened for no fault of yours but may be held against you. These papers take your office time and then you have meetings that never end and the work will start after 5.00pm. They actually have hired someone to help you write these papers. Amazon does not believe in ppt but believes in word documents. They are so frugal that they do not have a color printer on every floor. You may have to go 10 floors up or down to get that 1 colored copy. The seating space is so cramped up and they call it high density seating. You can actually touch 3-4 people if you stretch ur hand on both sides. There is a wait list for 2 years for parking in the building. So you eventually take a bus every day. All I would say is it is a big mess in AWS supply chain group. Which company hires and fires people in a period of 1 year, just because someone wrote something against you. The trust and healthy work culture does not exist. You will lose your health and hair in return of wealth that you cannot enjoy. It is not easy to survive in this place if you are not work smart, diplomatic, very fast paced and consistently vigilant to watch your back. Everyone leaves with a bitter taste. It is very common that on a Monday morning, your very next seat colleague is not at his seat because he worked his last on Friday and nobody knew it till he did not show up. Eventually you will learn he was recycled. Above all, there is no severance package and amazon takes every penny of your joining bonus and relocation back even if they lay you off and you did not resign out of your own will. So do not spend that money you get on something you like, because you never know how long you will be at AWS before you are long forgotten because the show must go on and there are lot of qualified people in the world that this company can afford to recycle. I never had experienced and never believed that a company has a culture that can ruin you, but there exists such a company- Amazon","My management changed every month.

The culture at Amazon is it's number one USP. It's just awesome. There is so much energy and activity. So many ideas and leaders actively seeking these idea..... it's uplifting and addictive! 2. The customer obsession here is legendary. There are so many stories, that it makes you feel proud to be a part of the organization no matter which department you work for. The focus is always the customer. 3. The freedom to disagree and be heard is another factor. If you are one of those who does not follow the crowd and don't hesitate to stand up for your own ideas, this place is for you, as long as you do it all respectfully. Amazon is one of the very few organization that actively encourages non-conformity and also gives you a platform to put forward your viewpoint without the fear of persecution from management. In fact the merits of your idea are explored and, if it's convincing enough, it becomes the operational procedure. 4. The CEO is another great reason. I just love Jeff, he is ""the man"" with ""the vision"". And this organization is only going to grow as long as he is at the helm.

57103,startup_6,"Redmond, WA"," Jul 28, 2014",Former Employee , Senior Software Development Engineer,My seven years at Microsoft,"Working @ Microsoft can be out of this world. Especially Main Campus. There is nothing else that really compares or even comes close to the experience. The diversity of people (be it cultures, age groups, backgrounds, genders, education) is amazing. Even the products that Microsoft creates is diverse. Compare that with Google or Facebook who only make advertising revenue.","Your experience will vary between teams, but one thing that was consistent (for me, at least) is that most of my time was spent focusing on politics and processes. Though I had the opportunity to work on some popular products, the only way I could ever get my work done (according to expectations) is if I stayed late in the day (most of the time was spent in meetings, dealing with build processes, iterating specs with the team, answering literally hundreds of e-mails a day, helping test team troubleshoot issues) -- unfortunately, a lot of this does not really get accounted in your workload, and in those cases where it does, it's almost impossible to correctly estimate how long those things will take, since it relies on your entire team to work 100% efficiently. I believe work/life balance is actually possible here, but it's only at the expense of getting a positive review. Accountability is important, but most of the time, it felt like I was taking the blame (or being punished for) someone else's poor performance on the team. At the same time, you don't want to point fingers, because it makes you look equally bad. Really the only time I was happy was when I was working late to make everything seem like it was on schedule, or I was on a team with no slackers. Sometimes people would not hold up their end of the workload (say if they were more junior people in their role) and management would expect you to help them do their job, but would not properly account for this in the estimates.  Over time I eventually learned to manage these things better with politics. Yes, people who have worked in corporations already are familiar with this problem, but at Microsoft, the politics are significantly magnified. People are super smart here and are always trying to make their job easier and take advantage of people who are not as politically savvy. Therein lies the true problem. I eventually left Microsoft, since it felt like most of my time (almost 70%) was spent politicking and handling processes. Coupled with a decrease quality in the products (the gradual results of their work environment) and a lot of other, good people leaving the company. Microsoft seemed to be going downhill.  Though Enterprise and Azure have really taken off recently, I don't think it will be enough to compensate for the decline of Windows revenue in the end. Surface was an unfortunate flop, and Windows Phone + Bing are sucking money from the company. Xbox 360 was doing great when I left, but now even Xbox One is looking like a poor performer, which is really concerning for the company as a whole, when you combine these things together. Office and Azure are really the only areas left that see significant potential and though Office 365 has showed promise, its revenue is really not enough to make up for the loss in Office desktop sales that are surely to come with the decline of Windows desktops.  So please be careful. It's no surprise they had layoffs recently. Despite most of them being in the Nokia division (because of the Nokia merger) still a considerable chunk of few people in Redmond (even top performers) were simply laid off because of the group they happened to be in. They were forced to leave or re-interview for a new positions in the company (which really does not work in your favor when many others are also interviewing due to of the lay offs). A similar approach was used in 2009. It was devastating to morale. Coupled with the ""layoffs continuing to happen over the course of the year"" really would not recommend anybody apply to Microsoft at least until late 2015.  The company is undergoing significant changes though to make it self ""more efficient."" But it's too soon to tell what that really means. Some people suspect that this will be the people who exercised their work/life balance, while at the same time, they will like increase the number of foreign workers who are willing to work the really crazy hours.  None of this is encouraging. Luckily, these days there are much better place to work and have a good life balance.  So now is definitely *NOT* the time to consider Microsoft. Look elsewhere and maybe reconsider in late 2015 is my humble recommendation.",Reduce the insane level of politics. Eliminate unnecessary processes and make them more efficient. Fix the company structure (sooner than later). Get rid of the opportunists in management (this may include Satya himself),1.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4

It really hits home when I have to try and hit a 20 word minimum for the pros when I practically wrote a novel on the cons.,"There is a palpable rift between management and fulfillment center tier one associates. Amazon knows they have a nearly unlimited supply of applicants who need jobs. For tier one associates the basic requirement is a high school diploma, however, there are several employees in the Haslet, TX FC who don't even have a diploma. Management isn't in the business of developing talent. Nearly every management position is filled from outside applicants, regardless if they have qualified individuals already working at the FC. I recently finished my M.S. in Aerospace Engineering and needed a job while I search for my career job. So I started as a seasonal tier one associate during Amazon's peak season. I figured while I was with Amazon I would try an advance myself, if for nothing else than to gain experience with networking and managing associates. However because I was a tier one associate, Amazon wouldn't allow me the opportunity to interview for an Area Manager position (tier 4), even though I far exceed the qualifications necessary for an Area Manager. I believed I should have at the very least been given an opportunity to interview when all other applicants are recent college graduates with only bachelors degrees with little to no life experience. In many cases these KIDS have never had a job making the Area Manager position their first job. I worked for a very reputable financial company as a Client Service Manager for just over two years as well as other various positions within the company the previous four for a total of six. I was told by all Senior Operation managers I would need to leave Amazon and reapply directly as an Area Manager. That puts me in a tough position considering I don't have two or three other jobs to fall back on. Then I recently had a SenOps person lie directly to my face and when that happened I lost all respect for Amazon and it's management structure. A large majority of the employees have a distaste for management and overall the atmosphere is extremely toxic, one without hope for advancement. If you're ambitious but don't have a degree and you would consider yourself ""old"" relative to the workforce, I wouldn't recommend working at an Amazon FC","Give more respect to your worker employees. A seismic shift is needed.

I worked for Apple, then left to pursue another career. A couple years ago I ended up in a city where it was difficult to pursue my occupation so I went to the Apple Store to interview for a position as a ""Genius."" I was so shocked at what its become-- or how I've changed, I'm not sure which.  Its like everyone snorts Zoloft. I appreciate being positive, but this was positive taken to the nth degree, a scary, conforming kind of positive. It's like everyone was looking around to make sure they were smiling at least 10% more than the others: and their eyes spoke fear. I like Apple overall, but Steve was a tyrant and the company greenlit some absolute steamers, against the advice of people who knew what they were talking about. Rather than admit they screwed up, though, the company religion is that Apple can do no wrong and you (the consumer, or the doubter) are the problem. As in, it was ""just too advanced for you"", or ""you just don't get it.""  I agree with another reviewer on the willing isolation and ignorance. Apple's OS X really was a thing of beauty when it was first rolled out… more than a decade ago. A decade. TEN YEARS. Ever since, we've been hopping along on forced upgrades that look more and more candy while sucking up more and more memory. Meanwhile, the Calendar app blows, iTunes blows, and Apple's push to exclude Microsoft Office from its mobile suite (in favor of everybody's favorite, ""Pages"") just annoys everybody who has to do something serious. Where's the innovation that changes someone's life?  Gone, because now Apple's cool. It's the popular kid, wearing the polos and the cardigans.

Benefits are good, 401k price match is pretty decent with a progressive scale over 5 years that ramps up from 50% to 100% matching.","You get treated like crap.  ""SWEATSHOP!!! YOU HAVE A FAMILY? YOU WON'T NOTICE IT"" The schedule during the iPod release was working from 10am to 3am every single day of the week for 3 months (Wife was furious). You may think that they would compensate with a nice fat BONUS for doing SO much work, but think again. We received roughly 5% of our salary as a bonus for the year. If you count your salary per hour, it's not pretty. Expect to do a LOT of overtime with little compensation for it.  ""YEARLY RAISES = INFLATION"" The yearly raises are such that the managers get 4% of the employee's salaries as a raise. They are then free to distribute the money however they feel like. So on average, people tend to get ~4% increase/year (this isn't necessarily bad, but it's also not necessarily good).  ""IT'S A ONE MAN SHOW"" It's ALL about Steve. He dictates everything from the corporate vision down to the position of the pixels. Although it's a great thing to have him there. Don't expect that your ideas will really make any headway into the products. You're more of monkey than a thinker (and that's a good thing for Apple as an investor, but a really bad thing as an employee).  ""VACATION TIME? WE'LL THINK ABOUT IT"" You really have to plan around Apple when you take vacation. Forget about taking anything longer than 2.5 weeks straight. They simply can't have you outside of Apple for that long even if you do have the time off. Every year, Apple has this plan where you can cash in 1 day of vacation if you take one day of vacation. ie: -2 days of vacations, you get paid for one day on your paycheck. A lot of people end up taking a day off (although still working on that day) only because they would otherwise have too many hours (it's just that hard to get vacation there).

The company's legendary customer obsession is truly part of its DNA - managers will not think twice to drive a single package 35 miles to a UPS sort center to make a shipping cutoff - the employees genuinely care. Amazon hires incredibly smart people, and you'll learn more in 6 months there than several years at other employers. The caliber of regional managers at the corporate level is very high - the overwhelming majority take an active interest in your development and want you to succeed.","Life at an FC is very different from the corporate Seattle experience - most FCs are only closed on Christmas Day, so almost every holiday (Memorial Day, Labor Day, July 4th, etc.) is typically a work day. Amazon's 24/7 schedule forces most managers to sleep by their cellphones, conference calls can occur at almost any time of day or night. Peak is a blur for FC employees - manager workdays span 16-18 hours a day and sometimes cross over the weekends - definitely an issue for families wanting a holiday with Mom or Dad. Amazon's culture is a little rougher than most large companies - ""constructive tension"" means that you need to feel comfortable going toe-to-toe with everyone from Area Managers to VPs if needed. While internal growth leads to promotion/transfer opportunities, it also creates a high level of open positions with work that needs to go somewhere. Relo benefits are lower than most companies - make sure you have a thorough understanding of the program and repayment period if you jump on board.","Amazon puts the customer first in everything, but Amazon hasn't recognized the importance of employee continuity to make that happen - while the company has rock-solid processes and training, an unsettling number of managers are leaving at the 1-2 year mark. There is a wide discrepancy in programs and opportunities between Seattle and the FCs - while relo is an option, there has to be more support for those individuals unable to move due to family commitments or the high cost of the Seattle market. Senior managers should make every effort to get out in the field - it's where the customer ""touch"" is the closest, and it's disheartening that the only time we see some of you is on a recorded video feed.",1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5

Upper management has had to change dates HR messed up my attendance record saying I was absent when that was not the case. Also it doesn't matter how hard you work you are not rewarded.

I've done inbound, sorting and scanning packages, water spider, staging, and cleanup sometimes all in the same day. I was given more to do and improved my work performance but was never given a raise so I stopped being great and just did the bare minimum of my job description which is to sort packages.

I came to Amazon looking for an opportunity to stretch and that has happened in every way. As an HR professional, I have to be open and objective. But, Amazon has stretched those skills, too. No problem or idea is too big or too small at Amazon. We're encouraged to think of better and more efficient ways to do everything. Nothing is off limits. Amazon is an environment for people who want to work hard and who want to do their best. I've had the chance to do that here.  Some describe Amazon's environment as tough and work hours intensive. I would challenge that and describe Amazon as an honest environment with open and frequent feedback. The number of hours you work at Amazon can be intense, but we play hard, too. I also think the number of hours we work is sometimes self imposed. When my friends and family ask me about whether or not Amazon would be a good fit for them, I balance my answer by what I know about them and not Amazon. If I know them to be hard workers with high standards and someone who consistently stretches themselves (raises the bar), I tell them they should come to Amazon tomorrow. If, however, I know them to like do things the easy way or to settle for ""okay"" in the things they do, I tell them that Amazon may not be a good fit for them.","Amazon is a large place and it's easy to get lost. You'll have to actively work to get to know people outside of your team. Amazon has a lot of Connections groups to help with this, but you have to make the time to do it. Amazon's Seattle location leaves a lot to be desired where diversity in ethnicity is concerned. The Seattle area has a very small population of people of color. So, living in the area can be a bit isolating.  The cost of living in Seattle can also be a shock. Be sure to do your research.  Amazon, and other large companies in the area, don't seem to be doing enough to help with the homeless population in Seattle. This responsibility probably shouldn't fall to private companies, but their growth is what drives the cost of living, which drives homelessness. The homeless population also affects Amazon employees who aren't from areas with large homeless populations. I've been here for almost 4 years and I'm still uncomfortable with the tent camps, solicitation in the downtown area, and the fact that people are in need.","My only advice is around the compensation model for a weird reason.

Through the Ambassador program, Amazon offers entry level 'leadership skills', welcoming new associates into the company/dept. - Workload.

This is also your best option for promotion. Amazon offers an attractive compensation package that pays for moving expenses to open new facilities.","- Overtime. Especially around holidays, the company expects you to work mandatory 50-60 hour weeks. To quote something I read on Facebook: 'Amazon, where you OD on OT.' - Schedule. During 'peak', those ten hour shifts get longer and longer. - Pay. I'd call it 'adequate', but not enough for the amount of work the company asks of you. - 'Bonus'. The 'monthly bonus' is calculated on the FC as a whole. So, the person making 80% gets the same paycheck as the person making 180%. Aside from 'positive feedback', the company does not recognize individual achievement when calculating this monthly 'bonus'. - Management. I have been working since I was 16 years old, and have never seen this much management turnover in my life. My department alone has gone through four managers and 'leads' in the last 18 months. I can't keep up with all the senior management turnover. - Turnover. Not a huge problem in my dept, but as a whole, Amazon has a large turnover rate, more so than most my previous jobs combined. Its hard work, long hours, not friendly to families or the elderly. - Constant Change. While this is a condition we signed up for, management is very unclear and nontransparent when it comes to such change. They observe you working with a stop watch and pedometer for a week, turn your dept upside down, raise rates, then expect you to 'adapt' and learn the new process. - Promotion, or lack thereof. The competition for these jobs are fierce, and graded on some kind of point system. Most of the time, the most qualified fail this system and the least qualified candidate gets the position. Despite the companies claim to transparency, the veil of secrecy surrounding these jobs remains shrouded.","- Listen to your associates more often.

If you are looking to work for Microsoft and want to grow your career, try to join the other business and product groups.  Consultants are expected to work on multiple projects to meet sometimes difficult utilization goals and held accountable even if their main job is to deliver and not sell. You will be expected to travel 100%. Instead of complementing the great products Microsoft makes, there is too much focus on quantity then quality which is doing nothing but hurting the Microsoft brand.  You will not be rewarded for your extra contributions and keeping customers happy, and helping grow the business even if you miss on a single negligible operational/administration commitment. Microsoft has done away with the stack ranking model but unfortunately some leadership in the consulting practice is still using this model.","This advise is for the Consulting practice management.

Resources not always used efficiently. Not enough information sharing between different groups. You're a small voice.,"The culture seems to be self-constraining itself in what it can do. There's too much pushback from people in saying what can and cannot be done. It seems like startups and many large competitors (aapl, goog) don't limit themselves in building off of the previous products and are more willing to not only think outside of the box, but execute on it too. There may be some good and cool stuff going on in MSR, but I'd be willing to bet you've got PMs and devs saying, ""No, we can't do that."" or ""That'll take six years and three iterations to get right."" whereas other companies will just go do it, and often times they'll get something pretty cool going and out the door. Not everything needs to be production and enterprise ready before previewing to market. Also, the software development cycle is too slow and resistant to change. Embrace some more agile and iterative methods of development. Assume a large percentage of your customers will have auto-update up and working. Make auto-update work better and more friendly (again, don't let those people who say ""it can't be done"" win. I'm sure WUS / MU can be made better, faster, and more user friendly.). Focus more on efficiency, everywhere. In internal communication, product efficiency, employee productivity, etc. Fixing this does not mean to launch a campaign, make a website, provide some tools and training. I mean, really get in there and figure out what the bottlenecks are, figure out how to improve things, have a discussion with the employees about their pain points and how to improve upon them. Don't take a random sampling, allow everyone to speak and have a voice, take feedback in the method of a poll / forum. Don't have someone who doesn't know what they're doing come up with a biased poll with biased questions that yield useless results (this happens way too often). I've plenty more to say but I'm tired of typing.  One last thing. For the senior senior management, I think Microsoft needs to find a place for the management that is no longer cutting it. Those that are too behind on the current developments / trends in technology or otherwise out of touch with the needs of the customers / employees / company / industry. They are not helping anyone.  One other last thing. Get better visionaries and empower them. I know things are reviewed and discussed to death, but then I still see Microsoft coming out with things that make me wonder how anyone thought they would succeed. Allow them to come out with things that are ""cool"" again. Look to aapl for inspiration if you need to. Especially with the iPhone (at least in terms of it's appeal / slickness).  I was proud to work at Microsoft, and still am proud to have worked there, but am becoming increasingly less so.  Stop listening to those people that push back and say it can't be done.

I worked at the sort center area scanning boxes and if I (or anyone else) stopped for a minute to ask another employee a question, a manager would be all over us telling us to get back to work. You're not allowed to use the restroom without asking a manager first. Sometimes they didn't have enough scanners around for all the employees, which was nerve-racking because we had a rate to meet every day and if we couldn't find a scanner we couldn't meet the rate. If a pallet of boxes fell over and we had to stop to re-stack them, we'd get asked by management later why we had ""time off task"" AKA we stopped scanning boxes for a few minutes. To put the icing on top of the cake, I was told that as a seasonal worker, if I showed up on time, didn't call off, and met my rate I would have the opportunity to become an official employee, not just seasonal. Never showed up late or called off (not once) and met my rate every day and still got let go after 3 months.","Remember that your staff, including the well underpaid managers, are human beings.

In theory, that process works well with the goals set by Amazon but again, the varied ways its put into practice is an issue.

Amazon has done quite a bit to engage with the employees...games, contests, raffles, etc. A free pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving and a Turkey dinner a few days before Christmas. We were paid for Thanksgiving and Christmas and will be paid for New Year's Day. There is VCP (variable compensation pay) that you get every month if your facility meets it's goal and you show up for work everyday and use none of your UPT (unpaid time off). It can be a nice chunk of money. You have the opportunity to sign up for Medical, Vision and Dental on day 1 and the monthly charge for those is cheap. They have more comprehensive medical coverage but expect to pay more. 401k is available and you are to shares of Amazon stock which you have access to after 2 years with the company. Check the price for Amazon stock and you'll see that it's quite a bit of money. Vacation accrues with every pay period and you start with 10 hours of PTO (personal time off) which also accrues every pay period. UPT starts with 10 hours and is replenished quarterly. UPT is used in hourly increments so if you are late 15 minutes, and you don,t have any PTO to use, It will cost you 1 hour of UPT. If you run out of PTO and UPT and your late that's pretty much it for you. The opportunity for advancement is there if you want to work for it but it is not going to be given to you.

Also the benefits are top notch. I work from home, so this is definitely a pro (and sometimes a con) as well. Also if you like to buy Apple products the discounts that you get are pretty decent.","Where do I start? 'All that glitters is not gold', 'The grass isn't always greener on the other side'. These are a few sayings that come to mind when people say they want to work for Apple. If you work in Applecare, you are a call center worker. No matter how they dress it up to you. Chat, Email or Phones. It's a call center, so comes with it the cons of working in a call center.  Shift Scheduling - Is absolutely abysmal. Depending on your department, you'll have to change your schedule in a little as every 3 months or 6 months. So say goodbye to any obligations you have outside of work, because when a shift is assigned to you. It's yours, and you have to work it. Yes, they try to sugar coat and say you can swap with someone else, but if it's already a crazy shift to begin with, nobody else is going to want it.  Work life Balance - Where? At the time of this writing you get no holidays off in Applecare (or weekends depending on your schedule). When I first started, you did. But now, nada. 365 days a year the queues are opened. However management (your manager) gets these days off (and weekends). How nice.  Work tools - Will never work properly. I've never worked at a company where there was so many issues with work tools. The kicker is you'll still need to be able to assist the customers and expected to get awesome CSATs with non-working tools.  Micromanagement - You'll never do anything right. If it's not one thing, it's another. Your manager will find fault in anything that you do, it's expected. Good calls or chats will still be nit picked and have endless ""one on ones"" on discussing how it could have been done better. They even have it written in policy on how long you are allowed to take bathroom breaks. Yep, even when you work from home.  Policy and Procedures - Can and will change without notice.You are told how to do something, you do it. A few months later it's wrong and should never be done like that. And when you ask why or when it was changed. No one can give you a straight answer. They'll give you the typical 'Apple BS giving you an answer, but not really answering your question' answer (with a smile on their face). Those that work in Applecare will know exactly what I'm referencing too.  Final thoughts. Management loves to ""cheerlead"" you through this muck of a work environment. They know what we have to go through isn't ideal and outright sucks, but they ignore it and speak to you like everything that is happening to you is good and we should be thankful for what Apple is doing for us. It's borderline ""cult like"". It's like serving you dog poop on a gold plate with gold utensils, and they try to convince you that it's good for you.","Nothing.

In fact, it's even worse now as your direct managers have more impact on your ranking and compensation so, if you don't kiss up to them, you get nothing. In fact, MS has been reducing all the benefits given to employees over the years. There used to be a top-notch benefit package and now you have co-pays and deductibles.

Instead of focusing on their reports, they have meetings every day with each other and rely on reports that are inaccurate and what an engineer puts on their check-in.

If he only was even 1/10th as smart in managing people and culture this would be a great place","The list will be long and read like many others... First and foremost, the core truth is that this company cares nothing for any employee without SVP or higher in their title... You are a replaceable part in the machine, and you will be told so. With the current market and their rising stock - it is true... there are lines of people waiting to work here and put this on their resume. You should be prepared to have a 2 year absence of a life outside work and be aware of that being the cost for putting this on your resume. Second, what isn't fully clear until you see the review process is that you will actually be penalized for the stock doing well. They have a target for what you should be paid (and it's not at the top of the market :)) and if the stock appreciates more now, you will simply receive less in the future. If this stock ever has a significant falloff half the people working here will be gone the next day. Third, micro-management is extreme - (from VP/SVP on down). You will be measured on taking ownership, but not ever truly allowed to have it. You will own any of the mistakes from your management chain on down - your management (director up) will own the success. If you come to work here you will learn things - some about technical skills, solving big problems - some about how not to run a company populated by human beings, but make sure you have a long term plan to leave before you start - as the compensation and value will start to rapidly diminish after 2 years.","I will give some - but I think the way the company is is EXACTLY as the senior management want it to be. They are too smart to have this situation be by anything but design. They want to bring in new blood, drain it dry, and then throw out the husks every few years - that is their management plan.  But, my advice would be to be careful about the ongoing top/bottom grading process, as you are starting to reach a point where the negative perceptions are hurting the ability to hire... you are 'raising the bar' with people who actually lower it and the long term future of the ability to compete in the tech sector is diminishing with this.",1.0,,2.0,2.0,2.0,36

Fundamentally, Apple Retail's corporate management is a thing all onto itself populated by strict RETAIL thinking unrelated to Apple Corporate's 'Think Different' goals & objectives (although they are in denial about this fact). There is a TALL wall of separation between the two. Bottom line you probably can't get a better job in retail but make no mistake -- you are not working for the Apple you think about when you think about Apple.","Still it's mindless, transactional, repetitive, erratic hour, dogmatic, customer satisfaction metric driven, burn-out prone, frustration filled RETAIL where you can't help but feel like you are living the same day over and over and mostly it is not so great a day after you've been there a few years. If you are an intelligent and creative minded individual, for all its benefits, staying in Apple Retail IS NOT easily sustainable. Agreeing with another reviewer: ""It's the coolest dead end job you will ever have"" because, unless you have a LOVE for retail management, there is nowhere to advance to technical or creatively despite Apple being known as a technology and creative driven company. It's not THAT Apple.","The view from the top has distorted your perspective. Yes, the game has changed from climbing to the top to staying on the top. Serving the lowest common denominator customer won't keep you there. Fight the temptation to play it safe even if it seems foolish. Go back to reckless innovation. Also, fix Apple Retail. They are bleeding out your best people replacing them with low end job desperate folks. Retail management has signed off on a 'use up, burn out and replace' strategy for populating your Apple Stores.

10669,startup_4,"Seattle, WA"," Sep 19, 2014",Current Employee , Software Development Engineer,A huge diverse high tech company with all sorts of stuff,"Disclaimer: My opinions reflect that of an SDE in Amazon. Seems like some operational job functions are very tough.  I have read through some of the other Amazon reviews and it seems to me that everyone has a very different experience! This is so true. Within the same team, you can have both workaholics and slackers coexisting and coworking together. I think I am more of the balanced type as I try to stay sane. The Amazon experience is basically the entire spectrum and it is what you make it out to be.  Pros in Amazon certainly excludes great benefits, but compensation is competitive. Free food means average quality free coffee, once in a while free pizza for lunch where it is a working lunch, and free beer and finger food in special events. We get a free Orca card to take any bus in the Seattle area for free. $160 per month subsidy for office parking, which is better than nothing. Downtown monthly parking goes for about $200 per month. 401K contribution is 50% of what you put in, where you can put in max 4% of your salary. Not so great. Staff cafeteria food is average and not at all cheaper than outside food, or could be even more expensive. It is hard not to complain about the cafeteria. Vacation days are ok but note that there are no sick leaves. They count as part of your 5 personal days per year. Listing the benefits of Amazon is like listing the cons and not the pros.  Work life balance seems to be ok for the most part, and seems to be individually-driven. No one will tell you that you have to come in at what time and stay till what time. I have team mates working every night and weekend, and others getting in at 10am and leaving at 5pm, all in the same team. Managers will focus on your project deliveries instead of how much time you spend working. If you work 40-hour weeks productively, you can definitely outperform someone who works 60-hour weeks but don't deliver stuff. Working less than 40 hours per week is somewhat common, but I can't say how many people are working how long. The view on work life balance is a bit skewed. All it comes down to are the managers and what they think. Projects are always never-ending but I have found that deadlines are very realistic and reasonable, without counting your nights and weekends. Getting some slack time once in a while is probably a sign of a healthy work environment. Everyone needs a break.  On-call really really sucks. Basically all it comes down to is having SDEs double-duty as support operations engineers. Note that on-call does not improve the code quality of any team in any way. The on-call experience is particularly bad because you are using services from some other team, and their code is of low quality and fails for the wrong reasons. If the managers had given more time to up the quality, there would not be so many problems. Software is usually delivered with a tough deadline with code that meets the minimum quality bar and never gets improved for the next few years. The code review process does not seem to help improve the code but it really obstructs developers from making great changes as unconventional things will not pass code review in clumsy minds. Innovation and excellence are not the name of the game in Amazon. Searching through the Amazon code base is usually not going to turn up quality code that you can actually reuse.  Integration is the name of the game in Amazon. You will need to spend a lot of time to figure out how to integrate your code with another team's services. Whether these other people are cooperative is a hit-or-miss. I have found that most people are responsive and helpful, but there are also quite a number of jerks who are out to make trouble for everybody. It is not easy to work across teams but the experience is mostly positive.  Amazon is a huge behemoth and is hiring people like there is no tomorrow. This reflects well on a good growth momentum but also is worrying that the company is not turning much profit. If the company does not make money, where is our bonus going to come from? You can see new faces around the Amazon building almost everyday! Downside is that we are taking in a lot of average to above-average engineers and being an Amazonian SDE certainly does not share the same reputation as the top names. Amazon is a huge mixed bag of some very talented people and some very dumb people. I think the world is not turning up enough SDEs and the only way is for quality to go downhill.  As an SDE, expect to spend most of your time talking, writing emails and documents, and maybe around 20-30% of your time coding. In most of the teams, you can work on interesting projects, but probably not revolutionary ones. Note that Amazon is a very down-to-earth company and the work is very down-to-earth as well. You will work on real things that people have actually requested for, and that people will start using as soon as you are done. Work is challenging but not to expect highly technically complex stuff. Most of the work has to do with solving everyday problems. To me, this seems to make sense because I have ever tried working on experimental projects before elsewhere and I did not feel it was a good use of my time.  Internal mobility is a key strength of Amazon, and I am not sure which company has done better than Amazon in this aspect. Internal moves are easy. You only need to stay in your team for a year before moving to a different team. There is no easy way to tell which team is a good team to move to because they all have their different pros and cons and people and coming and leaving all the time!  Seattle is by much rumour an easier place to live than the Bay area.  Overall Amazon is a tough but yet sane place to work. The flexibility of this company is really its core strength. You have the freedom to excel as much as you want and also to slack as much as you want. Bummer. You shouldn't be slacking!","Beware of bad managers and horrible team mates. They are not specific to Amazon but they do exist in Amazon.  I have to admit that Monday is usually a blue day at Amazon and it is very tough to look forward to getting into office. I don't know anyone in Amazon who looks forward to getting in on Mondays.  Be realistic about SDE requirements. Coding skills are good to have but they are not the most important part of your job. I think we are hearing the same thing from every company.  Medical coverage is average or below average. Expect to pay about $60 per month for singles and about $240 per month for families. $240 per month for families gives you $3000 in medical fees before you have to pay (more) anything out-of-pocket.  SDE advancement is unreal difficult. They have about 6 levels total, SDE 1-4, then Senior Principal Engineer, and finally Distinguished Engineer. The number of SDE 1s and 2s are huge. Trying to get to SDE 3 seems to be all-of-a-sudden extremely difficult, but not impossible. So this essentially means that if you come to Amazon as a fresh grad SDE, expect to get about only one or two promotions in your entire career, which obviously is quite a lame expectation and reality. You will probably do much better in your career advancement anywhere else.  Employee retention is horrible. I am not sure why the philosophy seems to be trying to undercut existing employees and then hire from external sources. Management all say that they are trying to retain people, but actions don't seem to suggest anything better. Rumour has it that annual pay raises are horrible. This basically mean that either you are a superstar in the company before they will try to retain you, or if you are smart you should not stay in Amazon for too long.",The thing about thinking long-term is getting more and more worrying as the company has not turned a tidy profit and is trying to conquer the world with its lofty expansion strategies. I don't know what kind of secret recipe management is cooking but seeing the company not making much money never feels comfortable.,,,,,,494

Some teams are customer and quality-focused, (but not all).","It's been said so many times, but the competitive ""stack-ranking"" review process is toxic and broken. While engineering management pays lots of lip-service to teamwork and collaboration, when it comes down to actual execution, employees are (rightly) more concerned with individual achievement and the ever-elusive ""visibility"" in order to get high review scores which translates into promotions and potentially lots of monetary reward.  For PMs in particular, the stack-rank reviews cause people to either consciously or unconsciously over-engineer product features to have more cross-team dependencies and greater complexity, since this leads to increased visibility and scope. People are rewarded for this, regardless of success or failure of the product/feature.  The fact is that individual work requirements and deliverables vary so widely that it hardly makes sense to compare them to each other -- it's an apples and oranges exercise. Attempting to apply the mythical man-month to creative engineering roles is inherently folly.  Another side effect is that there ends up being a huge amount of collaborative and dependency overhead, which limits teams' agility and ability to deliver on short timelines. In turn, this prevents Microsoft from being able to innovate or even ""fast-follow"" in an ever more dynamic technology market.  Microsoft has huge resources and influence, but on the whole there are relatively few products/teams that are able to deliver real value to customers in a timely way. The cash-cows of Windows and Office continue to bolster the company financially (i.e. ""nobody ever got fired for buying Microsoft""), which is a good thing for keeping the company profitable and stable, but it masks the fact that it's a lumbering beast of a company that's finding it increasingly difficult to compete and stay relevant in emerging technology markets.","Lose the stack rank, completely. Reward whole teams based on performance (strategic or financial, or some combination), and give more freedom to mid-senior and middle managers to reward individuals based on direct contribution to the products they own.  Senior- and principal-level managers often have great product design expertise and instincts, honed over years of good work, but this only rarely balanced with good people-management skills.

It is rare to meet an employee who has been at Amazon longer then three years.  Amazon likes to promote their tenets, but they mostly aren't followed. There is tons of technical debt and no one can really ""take ownership"" and solve any major issue. Amazon continue to succeed in spite of massive employee churn, but the company is running out of places to recruit new employees.

Down to about the 20th percentile of engineer, you can pretty much take their word as gold: if they say they'll do X in time Y, they will, and often a better X in a little less time than Y. This is a kind of super-power: it reduces the overhead of coordinating complex projects significantly.  Facebook is also a mission-focused organization, in the same sense that the military, or a relief agency is. Most employees understand the goal of the company to be larger than just making its employees and shareholders materially successful.  You will enjoy a vertiginous amount of authority as a front-line employee at Facebook. For better and for worse, on your first day at Facebook, you're given the keys to the proverbial Ferrari, you can push code, fix bugs, implement features, and yes, crash the site as much as any other engineer. Many user-facing decisions end up getting made by individual engineers.  This also implies that your work will have impact. Almost everyone you meet in your daily life is a user of your software. If they are unhappy users, it is your fault and responsibility to make it better. If they are happy users, you can enjoy your share of the credit.  All the basics (salary, equity, career advancement, food, miscellaneous perks like shuttles from SF) are world-class as well.","A mission-oriented job is not for everybody.

The Flex shift hours can allow one to feel like they have a good work life balance, especially if you don't mind missing a few paychecks. The break room is nice. They have a microwave and vending machines,and water coolers.","There are not many pros in the current configuration of Amazon Prime Now Flex. The workload has increased substantially and the manpower has been effectively reduced through the misuse of the flexible scheduling option. Some employees scramble to be online so they can snatch availability at the location I am associated with, some of them go for weeks with no hours available to work. I was shocked to see how insidious the lure of a change in status of employment from part time seasonal to a permanent Amazon hire was used to basically trick the unsuspecting employee into reducing hours for the company. Since the change, I see understaffing to the point that the managers have to pick product and the associate that has hours has to work at a fever pitch just to keep up with the demand.When the service launched there were,on average, eight employees on shift. Now there may be two and in some cases one. That is very abusive. One more thing. The managers do not care that you have been picking product from the time you clock in. Once you finish the task of picking and slamming products the expectation is that because they are so short staffed and need to have product put away or stowed they continue the grind you into the dirt...until your break, which you will need because the warehouse is so hot you drip sweat.",Please staff appropriately so you do not burn out the Part time seasonal employee. There can be no doubt that if the current pattern continues there will not be many associates that are willing to work as if they were three people.

Newly formed product groups especially have a fun 'start up' atmosphere with a lot of cross-discipline collaboration and everyone working together to get the job done. Full-time employees get very good health insurance. Cafeteria food is good and there is a reasonable variety, though as with anything it does get old after a while. The various campuses are generally nice and most of the buildings have enough windows to avoid the feeling of working in a basement. Depending on which group you are in, you may get to work on interesting new products. Most managers are extremely flexible with regard to the time of day you work. Working attire is essentially ""come as you are.""","I have worked at Microsoft for many years, first as an FTE then as a contractor (v-) so I have seen both sides of the coin.  Middle management is made up almost entirely of engineers instead of managers. While it can be nice to have managers understand the technical aspects of a project, very few good engineers go on to become good managers. Unfortunately, Microsoft almost never puts managers back into an individual contributor role unless the person specifically requests it, meaning bad managers get shuffled around leaving discontent in their wake.  Work-life balance can be seriously out of whack in some groups. This goes beyond the normal crunch-time chaos, multiple projects + hardware development builds every 4-8 weeks can easily lead to 6-12 months of 60+ hr weeks. Expectations for FTEs are always increasing, making it that much harder to maintain a work-life balance. Whatever you did to go ""above and beyond"" in the last review period becomes the minimum bar for the next review.  The review system fosters a competitive, rather than collaborative, environment. There is little incentive to help peers succeed as each person is stack ranked relative to the others in the group as ""assists"" aren't tracked or measured. If something goes wrong everyone scrambles to find somebody to blame instead of figuring out what happened and pull together to fix it.  With the economic downturn, MS cut contractor pay by 10-20% across the board. At the same time, most groups have limited contractors to 40 hrs/wk, putting lots of people under financial stress. Some managers are expecting their hourly contractors to put in an extra 10-20 hrs/wk, unpaid, to get the job done. There is definitely a sense that MS is using the current job market to take advantage of people.","Put managers in place that know how to motivate, inspire, and get the best out of their employees.

NO work, only SharePoint and exchange migration projects are running for last 2 years. No development work, no exciting opportunity. Very bad politics are running, no growth, no new learning, no benefits etc.  . MSGD is the lowest paying entity inside Microsoft. 7-10 years’ experience employee get same salary as freshers in Microsoft development center. . No stock bonus, as provided in other MS entity. . Yearly hikes are on average 4-6% far last 3 years. . Bonus payouts are also reduced over the last few years. . Promotion rate is very slow compare to other MS entity. On average, it takes 30 to 36 months/ even more than that in higher level. I know many people waiting for last 4 years in senior level to be promoted. . Join lower band compare to other MS entity. In MSGD starting level is 56, on the other hand most of the other MS entity starts from level 59/ 60. Level 60 in MSGD means very senior position with 15+ years of experience. This level difference very badly affect if you try to internally movie to any other MS entity. Most of the cases you need to join as almost freshers in other MS entities though you have 7-10 years’ experience and you are technically very sound. . Attrition rate is very high. Yearly 20-25% people leaving for last 3 years due to above reason/ politics, no opportunity etc. Onsite opportunity also reduced over the years. Some of the practice like ‘Productivity’ domain you should not expect any onsite opportunity in next 2-3 years. .

Most of the time they will ask to do some other activity apart from your work that will not going to bring any values to you nor the company.

I get to work with some of the smartest and innovative people on the planet. Amazon has made me better in everything I do. I came to Amazon looking for an opportunity to stretch and that has happened in every way. As an HR professional, I have to be open and objective. But, Amazon has stretched those skills, too. No problem or idea is too big or too small at Amazon. We're encouraged to think of better and more efficient ways to do everything. Nothing is off limits. Amazon is an environment for people who want to work hard and who want to do their best. I've had the chance to do that here.  Some describe Amazon's environment as tough and work hours intensive. I would challenge that and describe Amazon as an honest environment with open and frequent feedback. The number of hours you work at Amazon can be intense, but we play hard, too. I also think the number of hours we work is sometimes self imposed. When my friends and family ask me about whether or not Amazon would be a good fit for them, I balance my answer by what I know about them and not Amazon. If I know them to be hard workers with high standards and someone who consistently stretches themselves (raises the bar), I tell them they should come to Amazon tomorrow. If, however, I know them to like do things the easy way or to settle for ""okay"" in the things they do, I tell them that Amazon may not be a good fit for them.","Amazon is a large place and it's easy to get lost. You'll have to actively work to get to know people outside of your team. Amazon has a lot of Connections groups to help with this, but you have to make the time to do it. Amazon's Seattle location leaves a lot to be desired where diversity in ethnicity is concerned. The Seattle area has a very small population of people of color. So, living in the area can be a bit isolating.  The cost of living in Seattle can also be a shock. Be sure to do your research.  Amazon, and other large companies in the area, don't seem to be doing enough to help with the homeless population in Seattle. This responsibility probably shouldn't fall to private companies, but their growth is what drives the cost of living, which drives homelessness. The homeless population also affects Amazon employees who aren't from areas with large homeless populations. I've been here for almost 4 years and I'm still uncomfortable with the tent camps, solicitation in the downtown area, and the fact that people are in need.","My only advice is around the compensation model for a weird reason. Our shares have outperformed what any of us could have guessed. This leads to employees not getting increases because their share value has doubled or quadrupled.

I’m going to be as objective as Possible but this is also based on my experience at one warehouse, others could be run differently.***  Be aware of your team and train your ambassadors so they are able to properly train the team to do things consistently, accurately and with minimal downtime. Be mindful of unproductive people and address the issues. I’m in a warehouse that ships around 30,000 packages a night but if people were trained when hired and things were done productively, it could be accomplished with a third less staff in the same time. There’s 2 hours minimum on-boarding training videos you have to do before you start (Unpaid) that could EASILY include training on how to pick, pack, stow and load a van so people could be ready on day one and already know the basics. That is, if they didn’t give a completely different training on how to do things based on who’s there. (Very frustrating for someone who’s been a trainer). They could EASILY create an interactive training course on familiarizing yourself with how to read the labels etc, the post office does this before you’re even hired to be sure you understand what you’ll need to be able to do. Be mindful that “ambassador” is a supervisory role, and should be earned by people who are at minimum knowledgeable and experienced in the work and managing people.  All that being said, having an HR background I’ve seen enough to qualify for a hostile work environment case before I hit a month in. (Again, this is one location) Some management figures can be great and some seem to be too immature for the position (argumentative, bad mouthing corporate on day 1, unwilling to conform to upper management training procedures). Others have a lot of unnecessary back and forth with employees ultimately running them off for no reason.  Overall it’s an “easy” job (you can work up a sweat) that pays good money for what it is. Just block out the nonsense and get your work done. I gave it 3 stars because of the pay and benefits and ease of the job, it’s the same everyday.

Satisfied.","Google is the closest thing to a pure meritocracy that I've seen in this industry, and I've been in the industry a fair bit longer than most Googlers. It doesn't matter what your degree is in or how long you've been at the company -- if you get stuff done and do it well you'll be treated well. And, of course, the coworkers are luminaries, but they tend (in my experience) to be accepting of newcomers without the same background. I've had no trouble digging my fingers into topics from machine learning to the Java virtual machine, learning all the while. The company has some communication silos due to its size, but the walls aren't solid -- I routinely hack on other peoples' code, and they hack back. It's all very open.  They really pull out all the stops to make sure engineers can do their job, whether you need a second workstation, a thousand more machines in a datacenter, or scones. Information flow within the company is still quite free, particularly compared to Microsoft or Apple.  Managers I've interacted with are sharp and encourage good work-life balance, reminding employees to take time off and guarding against burnout. My managers have constantly communicated their expectations and our performance, and have actively worked to help me in my career development and promotions -- or, when a project slips off track, to understand why and help.  And, finally, I think Google's pay is pretty darn good. Microsoft recruiters assure me that it's 30% lower, but I've got friends at MS and those numbers just don't add up. This site should do a good job showing the true situation (and the resulting competition will help us all!).","You are expected to deliver. This doesn't mean 80-hour work weeks (at least in my end of the company), but you are expected to make goals and hold yourself to them -- and ideally deliver something that beats the rest of the industry while you're at it. Do not come to Google expecting a research environment, there's plenty of research going on, but if it's not in your 20% time you'd better have something to ship. I list this as a con only because I suspect this bit some of the people who rated Google negatively.  The company has grown really fast. This has caused some strain, both in terms of infrastructure and in communication. Many of the nooglers are fresh out of college, and the naivety cuts both ways: they're simultaneously over-eager to re-engineer everything in sight, and bitter when perks change or they don't get promoted fast (nevermind that it's still better than the rest of the industry -- they've never been there). With rapid growth comes a lack of focus, as well, with weird projects with no monetization story. (Caveat: I'm in Ads, where money matters.)  I get the impression that we've got our share of bad managers. My manager (and the two immediately above him) are all great -- technically sharp, caring, and happy to get their hands dirty. But I've heard horror stories from other teams, and you can read plenty of them on this site, I'm sure -- preference for low employee numbers, suckups and yes-men, etc. I suspect most of the thoroughly bitter people have gotten a bad manager and not requested a transfer out from under him/her.  On that note, Google does a bad job of handling underperformers. They try hard to help crappy engineers and managers improve, but at some point you've got to cut your losses -- a bad employee, particularly one with a bad attitude, is poison that eats away at morale. I've seen people go through two or more performance improvement plans before finally getting the much-needed axe.  Google also does a fair-to-middling job of handling *overperformers*. I've gotten a few spot bonuses for successful projects (which, to be fair, were tens of times larger than the bonuses I got at similarly-sized companies in the past), but the motivating effect of the Founder's Awards are gone. No matter how many millions of dollars you make the company, if you're not in LSE's pet segments, no Founder's Award for you -- it'll go to some guys in search or something. Google is done making millionaires -- for those of us who got who got here after the IPO, the only way we'll retire is a 401(k). Again, having worked in industry outside of Google, this makes me wistful but not angry. I don't expect other people to make me a millionare.  And, finally, your family will ask you questions about everything Google related.

The first team manager was hardly ever available, when she was, she had her favorite lead speak for her. It was unfair regarding salary review, and very very cliquey regarding group gatherings. Many of the leads were unprofessional and treated retail csa's rudely but were never called on it. Everybody could audit everyone, and the gossip was out of control.

If you have any kind of desired to move up, do not get hired as a hourly employee. The ability to move from hourly to salary depends on the department and it could take a long time for the department to even have open salary positions. Moving from department to department can be difficult as well unless you are good at selling yourself and being very bright and shiny. If you are just extremely good at working, but not really advocating for yourself, then this is not the type of company for you. The stock options are good, but are much better if you can get hired on as salary. Management positions are compensated well from everything that has been talked about. However, it seems management only does X amount of the actual work and more or less are in meetings day in and day out.","Work life balance can be hard if you want to promote within the company. Those who are not as knowledgeable, but more willing to advocate for themselves, will move up. If you are hired in as an hourly, you are going to have a hard time moving up the levels. Company is always pushing equality above quality. You are part of a machine that is moving at a blazing speed, if you can't keep up you will burn out. If you don't agree with your manager, you have the ability to say something, but not the ability to make them listen. Even if you have a large number of other employees saying the same thing.",Start thinking about retention of good employees and less about public appearance.

It was not possible to take a certain day 40 mins for lunch and then stay 10 mins longer to compensate it. After 30 min 25 seconds your manager received an automatic email warning him that you have overpassed the permitted time for lunch. During the black season they introduced the rule of 6 mins to go to the toilet, so sometimes you had to explain to your manager why a certain day you stayed 1é minutes in the loo.

Glad to see Satya in charge (and ballmer long gone). Its a good time to consider MS!","Many things pop-up when you've been somewhere for decades, but one thing that I like to mention here is this HR policy, where even if you have years of industry experience, or even if you are technically qualified, yet you are treated as a college hire no matter if a hiring team might find you as fully qualified or not.  Basically, hiring teams don't really get to see you in order to evaluate your qualification unless they have a req for a college hire. This means that you as a candidate have less opportunities since you are pushed into a smaller set of job-opening (and auto-rejected from industry-hire category), and you as a hiring team are being excluded from considering candidates that are technically qualified.  This seems insane, policy trumps qualification!  It was like this when I joined back the end of the last century! Crazy that such an irrational policy is still the HR mantra.  I can whine about stack ranking and such, but many people have in the past, so I'll let it go.","Assuming you want to hire qualified candidates, then demand HR to stop filtering your evaluation of candidates based on being fresh out of college (mind you, even for 1 year after graduation).

Funding for projects is mostly based upon political favoritism and/or the latest MBA prepared Powerpoint, and rarely on the real merits of the product to the marketplace. Rarely, if ever, are projects and their respective costs truly measured repeatedly for their ROI--look at Search. --Bad news is not embraced and respected, the messenger is typically shot or stamped as not being a ""real team player"". --The performance review process has been completely bastardized to focus on individual efforts over team/product delivery, it's more important to determine what your boss wants to see and deliver on that than what the product and/or customer need. The politics of the review process, especially the last month or two prior to the ""ranking/lifeboat exercise"", are more important than everything you did over the other 10 months. --No one cares what your contribution over several years meant to the company, ""What did you do for me this last six months?"" is all that matters. --You are one re-org away from having your career at the company terminated.

Make the review processes more transparent and not controlled by the manager only.  Amazon is probably the least collaborative work environment I have seen among the few companies I have worked at. This really hurts Amazon's employee productivity. It's a very negatively competitive environment where people are only rewarded for their own personal productivity for the narrow goals that they are set to achieve and not for how much they contribute towards the productivity of the whole group - this makes them inclined towards not helping each other and tend to not volunteer information (which is usually not documented well) that would make other people more productive.  The surprising thing is that there are lot of good-hearted people at Amazon -and they still end up helping each other to some degree (like in grad school) - just as human beings with souls- despite the huge disincentives created by the work environment and reward structure.  There is an easy way to fix this - reward people based on their soft goals also- make sure the time alloted for projects separates out the time that the manager requires you to spend helping other employees- new ones, junior ones, and in collaborative scenarios where one of them does not ""own"" the problem. This will help people find the balance- especially your most productive, knowledgeable people - not the opposite - force them to leave Amazon because they are pounded by extra load as they become more and more effective every month!

The best thing about working at Apple is your coworkers. They do an excellent job of hiring incredibly intelligent, talented people. It's quite humbling to work alongside such accomplished people. You'll always feel like the dumbest person in the room, which is great because everyone has so much to teach you. Most of them are ego-free (about 70% of them) and will help you whenever possible. There are so many personality types, though nearly all of them are perfectionist Type A people. If that is your kind of crew, you'll do well.  The work usually comes in waves. When you're on, you're all the way on. For weeks at a time you can expect late nights and no weekends. On the flip side, when it's slow, it's very slow. You can often work from home or take comp days. During downtimes it is not uncommon to go in for five hours including a long lunch and then go home.  In addition to this, the compensation is good. The stock program is okay. But the pay is more than fair and their annual reviews pretty much guarantee a raise, bonus, and/or more stock.  Finally, Tim Cook seems like a genuinely good person. Even in the relatively short time he's been in his role, he has made enormous leaps to give that company a real set of values that are current with this generation. He feels like a real human being, which is something Apple desperately needs.","Creatively speaking, this place is hellish. They hire people to do one job and one job only. Great creative happens when you're exposed to a lot of different projects and people, not in a vacuum. Apple will make you sit in your sandbox and churn out a huge amount of work for a single thing. And don't you dare look at someone else's sandbox. They live by the phrase ""individual contributor"". It's not collaborative in the least. This creates a giant divide between creative teams and roles, a divide that can be frustrating, isolating, and overwhelming.  On top of that the management style and structure is a disaster. Prepare for massive insecurity, nitpicking, micromanagement, unrealistic expectations, information silos, finger-pointing, miscommunication between management titles, and all the unfortunately awful qualities so often associated with the dreaded ""middle management"". Meanwhile the people at the top, who could actually effect change, have earned the right to be blissfully unaware. There are too many people in leadership positions who have been at Apple entirely too long and have little or no experience with other creative work environments. They are stale, ignorant, and arrogant.","When a subordinate questions anything structurally at Apple, the answer will inevitably be, ""That's just the way it is here."" Horrible. That should NEVER be the answer to ANYTHING. As a manager, this is a missed teaching opportunity that shows your employees you do not care about investing in their understanding of the company. It's the management equivalent of a parent saying, ""Because I said so"". That's so lazy.  Let your people have ownership. Recruiters go through so much to bring in the best and brightest, just to have them treated like they are several years and steps behind that which they are capable. Have faith in the employees you brought on. Don't spend every waking moment with your hands on their hands. It's exhausting to your subordinates and eventually it becomes downright scary. They end up dreading every interaction they have with you, because nothing feels like it will be good enough and it's crazy-making trying to guess which of the hundreds of options you've already thought up will be the chosen one. Empower your employees to have creative freedom and confidence within that. Too much time is spent telling people all of the ways they aren't getting the Apple look/feel/voice/whatever.  Managers should also be educated on other roles within the creative process. It's impossible to collaborate when your boss inherently does not understand what their subordinates' teammates do. Constantly having to ask people to do something that is near impossible or would add several hours of work onto their day just to appease an uneducated supervisor is a special form of occupational torture.",2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,11

22095,startup_4,"Seattle, WA"," May 14, 2015",Current Employee , Anonymous Employee,Manage your expectations & have an exit strategy,"+ You made it! You’ve been hired after a grueling interview process that included everyone you’ll be working with and your entire management chain. They made a point of annoying you just to see how you reacted and you kept your cool and showed your smarts. You’re golden!   + Casual atmosphere -- you can wear shorts, t-shirts and flip-flops -- and you can bring your dog to work.   + Because of the “bar raising” efforts, there is a constant influx of smart, driven, talented people that you’ll be working with.   + You’re given a lot of responsibility in your area and a lot of freedom to forge your own path to get things done (using open-source tools, coming up with new processes, etc.)   + You will learn a lot. You’ll be drinking from the firehose. It’s exciting and often overwhelming.   + Initial compensation is very competitive, especially while you’re still getting your signing bonus","- All those smart, driven people that they’re hiring? Every person who’s hired after you is your direct competition. The theory is that every new hire has to be better than the existing average (thus “raising the bar”), and this combined with high turnover and a stack-ranking employee review process means that the longer you stay, the more endangered your position becomes. Knowing how things work does not outweigh being “good on paper” and a new hire.   - Constant employee turnover. Our team lost its entire marketing department within a six-month period. Senior management blamed this on the team and decided to reorganize. And I’ve seen this happen to at least 3 other departments within 2½ years. It lowers employee morale and makes it incredibly difficult to get anything done, since no one has institutional knowledge extending farther than a year or two.   - Chaotic, undocumented, ever-changing processes. All that turnover plus an unhealthy insistence on new launches instead of maintenance & upkeep of existing products means that there is little to no documentation, and you’ll be lucky if you can track down someone who knows how the system is built. This means a lot of emergency trouble tickets and on-call drama for some teams, and a lot of headaches and finding workarounds for others.   - Managerial scapegoating at all levels. This can happen to entire divisions, as well as to individuals. If you are working here and having trouble fitting in, now is the time to evaluate your exit strategy.   - Capricious, poorly communicated, and barely-planned leadership decisions. For a data-driven company, almost all planning decisions seem to originate in the VP’s gut.   - No work-life balance. The only people who get ahead are the ones who ruin their health and sanity by spending all their time in the office. Then they burn out and have to take extended leaves of absence.   - Almost no promotion potential. Make no mistake -- they’re hiring externally for the higher-level positions. During the last round of reviews, out of a team of 200+ workers, 5 people rose one level. Mostly from level I to level II. Your raise, if you’re lucky, will be about 1%.   - Deceptive compensation messaging. You’re told that your “total compensation package” equals $X, but a good third of it is likely in RSUs that only vest after a long time with the company. Remember that employee turnover is such that most people don’t outlast a year or two -- so very few people are going to see the compensation advertised. Despite what they will tell you in the interview, it’s probably a good idea to evaluate the compensation on the base pay, because that’s mostly what you’ll be seeing. (Along with your signing bonus for the honeymoon period.)   - Short-term thinking. This is probably the root cause of all the lack of organization, capricious decision-making, and turnover. No one in the upper management is thinking beyond the next feature launch, the next organizational planning document, the next round of employee reviews. This may be standard in the tech world, but it almost certainly means that without some real investment in vision and strategy across the board, Amazon will be taken down by “the next big thing” when it shows up.","Reconsider the stack-ranking review process. It creates a toxic, political environment that dampens morale and keeps people on a knife-edge of anxiety for months at a time.  Use all that data to make strategic, not tactical decisions.

Sideways mobility between software engineering groups. The scale of its operations are amazing. For its size, it is still one of the best companies to work for. It is very well run. Perks. A culture that doesn't prohibit fun, and in some sense encourages it.","Long hours: It depends on the individual, but it's easy to feel that you need to produce more and ending up selling yourself short. The work involves a lot of time wasting ""archaeology"" - sifting through wikis, code labs and other people's code figuring out what is the latest recommended way to do something that sounds boiler-plate and obvious, so it's easy to feel unproductive at times. Also, the availability of free food, gym, etc. on campus and the plenty of fun distractions on its corp network make it easy to spend more time there.  Hard to be visible and make an impact. Visibility and Impact are the economy by which software engineers are measured, and they are becoming harder to come by. I feel that most joining now are likely to end up being just a number: average (in Google standards) impact and zero visibility, irrespective of how much of a rock star they were in their previous jobs.  It's becoming more and more the target of lawsuits, which basically means that legal fees will continue to cut a larger share of its revenues. In general, operating margins have been decreasing, although they are still amazing. I'm not saying that legal fees are the reason for decreasing operating margins. Google is investing heavily (in new hires, acquisitions, etc) and any benefits from this spike in investment will take some time to catch up with the costs, and there is no guarantee that they ever will.  I am a relatively recent (post-recession) hire, and after way over a year on the job I still feel that I am evaluating Google and wondering whether I can have a career here, which is not a good sign. Compared to previous jobs, I feel less recognized, having to work more, less proud of my work, and being more conscious on the effect that specific projects will have on my career instead of just doing what is right for the users/company. It is not that I am less smart/capable/experienced than others, it's just that the opportunities are less compared to someone who joined earlier. The work is not the most interesting I ever done, but it is OK and gives me the opportunity to expand my technical breadth. If this is all Google needs from me, then I am likely to move on, more sooner than later, and if this is a common experience of the relatively recent hires then the smartest and the brightest will not be flocking to Google anymore. Nothing particularly wrong with Google, I assume that's part of a company's normal progression from start-up to behemoth, and I still recommend giving Google a try, especially for new grads as it can be a good place to jump-start an engineering career.

Community involvement in the form of blogging, attending industry events, presenting, and even time for charity work are all highly encouraged. The medical benefits are the best of any US company, hands down - I have never paid a penny for any clinic or hospital visit, including when my child was born.

You will be expected to guide your own career and to be responsible for much of your own learning. This means that you'll probably always be reading up on something and will always feel a littel behind. You'll never acheive a comfort zone in terms of career growth. The environment is competetive, and laid back types who just want to ""come in and do my job"" will be limited in how far they can advance. Travel is required. Working with outsourcers overseas can be stressful and unrewarding because there is no mentoring relationship to speak of - you will be dealing with lowest common denominator individuals overseas who have no incentive to learn or better themselves because the people back in the States can always get them out of a bind.

However, over the years employee's expectations have become so high, that when an individual is in a poor job situation, they feel like Google owes them something better. So you have people who sit in a role/team/dept thinking the situation will get better or that management has a good plan, and they'll be fine once they give it a few months. In reality, that person is either overqualified for the role or a bad fit, but are too complacent to change. Many employees can't even fathom leaving Google, so they sit there and hope it works out and will figure it out once the new dream role opens up. But that doesn't happen and so they wait it out until the next reorg. The cycle continues.","Performance reviews: make them real-time. Good employees get lost in the shuffle when their manager structure changes in every reorg (For example, in my 10 years, I had 49 job classification changes, even though I only changed jobs technically once). Also, overhaul middle management. You've hired smart people for a reason, but now you have too many management layers.",2.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,4

Microsoft is truly an amazing place. * Extremely smart people * Truly innovative * Amazing benefits * Your work is truly valued * If your organization and management believe in your long-term potential and your ability to grow and lead, there are leadership development programs (HiPo/High Potential Program, Key Talent, etc.) * Ability to experience various products, services, organizations etc. * Things are positively changing under the leadership of Satya Nadella. There is a positive buzz internally, the industry and investors are responding positively. Our stock prices have shot up. We are truly embracing change and newer/innovative products (Hololens, Surface Book etc.) are being released. * Under Satya's leadership and new review model, Employees are measured on business impact (reduces unnecessary politics and brown-nosing, and focus is on impact/results), how they leverage the work of others and build on top of others work (reduces duplication of work across teams/organizations, and increases collaboration), and how employees have helped others to be successful (focus changes from individual success to team success). * Microsoft has done away with the older performance review system (1 - Outstanding ... all the way to 5 - Very poor/no impact). This was a forced curve, meaning people managers had to find employees to fit in each category leading to some unfavorable behavior and culture. The newer model no longer rates employees on the 1-5 scale, and there is no ""calibration"" exercise (forced curve). However, as a manager one still has to 'differentiate' employees based on impact. * Satya meets with his directs and product group leaders/engineering leaders weekly/several times a month. He also has frequent employee all-hands where he talks to employees, and everyone in the company has a chance to ask him questions directly. He is well connected with his leadership team, knows what is happening at the top across the company, and he is well connected with employees at the grass-root level. True leader and positively leading the company in the right direction","* Microsoft truly has some amazing products and technologies but we don't always do a good job of telling the story about our products. Our competitors often make a huge deal of features and functionalities that Microsoft products have had in years. Even as a FTE and 10+ years at the company (true blue Microsoftie), I often come across things in our products I didn't know existed. We can do better in that area. To give credit where due though, under the leadership of our (relatively) new EVP Marketing - Chris Capossella, there are truly impactful, meaningful and inspiring advertisements, and marketing strategies that reflect the power and potential of Microsoft products, better than how we have done in the past. * While Benefits are better than many other companies, it used to be better a few years ago. Medical was ""free"" and Microsoft took care of all the medical expenses. With the changes a few years ago, preventive care is 'free' but employees have a co-pay for all other medical expenses. * Compared to similar tech companies like Facebook and Google, we don't have ""Free Food"" although ""Free Soda/Juices"" are available in every building. * Sometimes things may not seem very transparent across management layers and working across teams may sometimes seem complicated. But with the newer One Microsoft philosophy and way of working under Satya's leadership, there is way less politics and way more collaboration, and partnership. * Moving across organizations is relatively challenging (eg. moving from IT to Engineering/Product Group), also cross-org movement after a certain level (Level 65) is challenging. If you want to experience different orgs, move while still a L63 or 64. * Likewise L65 and above is a shark-tank.",More transparency across layers.,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1
